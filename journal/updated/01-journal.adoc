== The Journal of Richard Davies.

I was born in the year 1635, in the town of Welch-pool in Montgomeryshire,
in North Wales, of honest parents who had a small estate there.
I was brought up in a little learning,
and in the religion and discipline of the church of England.
When I came to be about twelve or thirteen years of age,
the Lord put His fear in my heart, so that I came to the consideration
of what would become of my soul if I should die,
if I lived after the way that some of my companions did;
and a desire came into my heart to leave them.

I was inclined to go and hear sermons, and followed the best of those sort of people
which I believed feared the Lord, which I then thought were the Independent people;
especially one Vavasor Powell, who was a very zealous man in his day and time.
He took much pains and labour to gather a people into that persuasion,
and many were gathered to it in these parts.
I followed them from one parish to another, and from one meeting to another,
writing down their sermons, and in time I came to repeat them to the people.
While there, being exercised in the historical part of the scriptures,
I could speak and talk of them, so that those people came to speak well of me.
This served to puff me up, so that I was not so serious
as I should have been to get eternal life by Christ Jesus, who is the life Himself,
who said to the Jews in John 5:39 & 40, "`You search the Scriptures,
for in them you think you have eternal life, and they are they which testify of Me.
But you are not willing to come to Me that you may have life.`"
We were diligent in searching the scriptures, which was good in its place,
but the main matter and substance of pure religion
is the enjoyment of eternal life to the soul from Christ.

About the fourteenth year of my age,
my father intended to make me an apprentice to a shopkeeper,
where I had gone to make a trial of that trade,
but I saw that the conduct of my intended master was not right,
and that the fear of the Lord was not there.
I was afraid that if I continued there,
the little love and zeal I had to God and goodness
would be choked and quenched in me,
and the love and pleasure of the world would rise up again,
so that I would be in danger of growing worse than ever.
Being under these serious considerations,
I heartily prayed to God with tenderness and tears
what He put in my heart to pray for,
namely, that I might be delivered from that place where I
was intended to be bound an apprentice, and that I might spend my time with and among
those who feared the Lord,
and thought upon His name. The Lord heard my prayers,
and in a little time I was sent for away from that place.

After this I stayed at home some time,
and continued in that little well-doing I had known,
keeping company with sober and honest people. I delighted to read the scriptures,
and to go to the Independent meetings.
After some time, I heard of a man that professed the same religion,
who was very zealous for a time in going to meetings
and performing that which we call family duties, and,
with the consent of my parents, I bound myself as an apprentice to him.
His name was Evan Jones, a felt-maker, in the parish of Llanfair, in Montgomeryshire.
We went together to meetings, I writing and repeating sermons,
and performing that custom that was among us,
in praying in our own will and time,
till we had become so dead and formal,
carnal and airy (with many loose words and actions growing up amongst us)
that I ran out into great imaginations concerning myself
and our formal religion. But still there was something in me that
reproved me for my vanity, for when I arose from my prayers,
being sometimes in a weighty ponderous condition, I saw that there was
something that gave me no true peace nor comfort inwardly to my soul, because there
remained a secret pride and self-exaltation in most, if not all, of our formal performances.

In this state and condition I knew not what to do. When neither writing,
repeating sermons, reading of the scriptures and other good books,
and sometimes expounding them to the best of my understanding, afforded me any comfort,
I was at a loss, and knew not what way to take
that I might have peace and comfort in my performances.
Hitherto I knew not the Holy Spirit of the Lord, as I ought to have done,
to be my leader and guide into all things that were necessary to my eternal salvation.

Upon a certain time we had a meeting at Hugh David`'s, a tenant of Charles Lloyd`'s,
of Dolobran, where one of our Independent teachers, who was a great scripturian,
was preaching, while I wrote down his words after him. In his sermon he said,
"`The time would come that there would be no need of the scriptures,
any more than another book,`" at which I very much stumbled,
and after the meeting I asked him when that time would be.
He said, "`when the Lord would make a new covenant with His people,`"
as it is said in Jeremiah 31:33-34,
"`I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel; after those days, says the Lord,
I will put My law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts,
and I will be their God, and they shall be My people.
And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour,
and every man his brother, saying, '`Know the Lord;`' for they shall all know Me,
from the least of them unto the greatest of them, says the Lord;
for I will forgive their iniquity,
and I will remember their sin no more.`"
It seems this man had not experienced that day to have already come,
though he was a great preacher. I thought it would be a happy day,
when God Himself would be the teacher of His people,
so that we need not teach every man his neighbour, or his brother, saying,
"`Know the Lord;`" but that we would all know Him, from the least to the greatest.
This day we knew not then, despite all our preaching and long prayers,
though the Lord did then beget true hungerings and thirstings in our souls after Him.
We had great love and zeal, and desired the knowledge of the truth as it is in Jesus.
Sometimes I have said this was but like Jacob`'s dream, when he awoke and said,
"`Surely the Lord is in this place, and I knew it not.`"
And indeed we knew not the Lord as we ought to have done, namely, by His light, grace,
and Spirit shining in our hearts,
to give us the light of the knowledge of the Son of God,
which knowledge keeps a man meek and humble.
Such are not puffed up in a vain mind,
to seek after those things that are too high for them;
too many are climbing up in that way, which is not the way to God the Father.
The way to the Father is the way of holiness and purity, and humility,
without which no man shall see the Lord, nor enjoy His presence to their comfort.

About this time, being in the year 1656, our ministers told us
that there was a sort of people emerging in the north, called Quakers,
that were a people of strange practice and principles, saying
that these were the last days and times which Christ spoke of in the 24th of Matthew:
"`Many shall come in My name, and deceive many,
for there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets,
and shall show great signs and wonders, insomuch that if it were possible,
they shall deceive the very elect.`"
This sort of people called Quakers were much preached against;
our ministers told us they were the false prophets, etc., that they denied the scriptures,
and all ordinances, and also denied the very Christ that bought them.
They were represented to us to be such a dangerous sort of people,
that we were afraid of any who had the name of a Quaker,
lest we should be deceived by them.
Hitherto they had not been in these parts of the country,
nor did we know what principles they held,
but only such as were reported, though falsely, unto us by our preachers and others.
This kept us in blindness, and from making further inquiry, by
"`trying all things, and holding fast that which is good,`"
according to the apostle`'s advice, 1 Thess. 5:21.

Now about the year 1657, there came a poor man dressed
in plain apparel to my master`'s house named Morgan Evan, of South Wales.
He had met with the people called Quakers in his travels, and was convinced of the truth.
This poor man discoursed with my master about the principles of truth,
and I being in the shop about my work, my mistress came and said,
"`Why do you not go out to help your master, for there
is a Quaker at the door that has put him to silence.`"
Upon hearing this, I made haste and took my bible under my arm,
and put on what courage I could to dispute with that poor man;
but he proved too hard for us all. When I went to them,
they were discoursing upon the words Thee and Thou;
but I very peremptorily asked him
by which command he spoke Thee and Thou;^
footnote:[At this time in history, the correct and plain use of "`thee`" and "`thou`"
to one person was beginning to give way to "`you`" and "`your.`"
Most modern English speakers are unaware that the words "`you`" and "`your`" were
originally plural pronouns used only to address two or more people,
whereas "`thee`" and "`thou`" were used to address a single person.
In the 1600`'s, it became fashionable (as a means of showing honor or flattery)
to use the plural "`you`" or "`your`" in addressing people of higher social status,
while "`thee`" and "`thou`" were reserved for servants, children,
or people of lower social or economic position.
Early Friends stuck to what was then considered "`plain language`"
(using thee and thou to every single person, and you and your to two or more),
rather than showing preferment by addressing certain individuals in the plural.]
for I acknowledged
that it was the language of God to Adam, and the language of the scripture,
"`but,`" said I,
"`that is not enough for us now in this day, we must have a command for it.`"
To which he answered, "`Hold fast the form of sound words,
which you have heard of me.`" I asked him whether that was scripture;
he asked me whether I would deny it; I told him he must to prove it.
Then he took the bible out of my hand, and turned to 2 Tim. 1:13, which he read,
and told me that "`Hold fast`" there was a command, which I knew very well,
both the scripture and the command. But to prove him further,
I desired him to read a little more of that chapter, both before and after,
which he freely did, and asked me why I asked him to do so.
I told him that we heard the Quakers denied the scripture,
and that they would not read them.
He said there were many false reports of them.
And truly when he read the scripture so readily, I concluded in myself
that what was reported of them was not true;
and he saw that he had reached to the witness of God in me.
Then he exhorted me to take heed to that light that shined in my heart,
which showed me my vain thoughts,
and reproved me in secret for every idle word and action, saying
that "`that was the true light,
which enlightens every man that comes into the world.`" And in that light,
I would see more light, which would open the scriptures to me,
so that I would receive a measure of the same Spirit that gave them forth.
He further told me that this Spirit or light was "`the more sure word of prophecy,
unto which I did well if I took heed, as unto a light that shines in a dark place,
until the day dawn
and the day-star arise in your hearts,`" 2 Pet.
1:19. And he spoke much of the inward work,
and the operation of God`'s Holy Spirit upon the soul,
recommending me to the "`Grace of God, that brings salvation, teaching us, that,
denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly,
righteously and godly in this present world,`" Tit. 2:11-12.
And so he departed from our house, and I accompanied him for a little while on his way.

Now when I returned from walking with him,
the consideration of his words took deep hold upon me,
so that I could not go out from under them;
and the more I waited in that light that he recommended me to,
the more my former peace and that in which I formerly took comfort
was broken; and herein I came to see
that our former building could not stand,
for we built upon that which the apostle called "`wood, hay, and stubble.`"
Here I came to a loss of all my former knowledge,
and my former performances proved but a sandy foundation.
Then I, with much humility and poverty of spirit, begged of Almighty God,
that I might build upon that rock that the true church of Christ was built upon,
that the gates of hell might not prevail against me.

But for all this, I was yet afraid of being deceived by the Quakers;
yet where to go outwardly for advice and counsel I knew not,
for I saw that my former teachers were upon a sandy foundation.
So I desired that the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,
would be my Teacher and Instructor;
for I believed that the prophecy of the prophets would be fulfilled,
and that the Lord would make a new covenant with His people now,
as He promised by the mouth of the prophet Jeremiah:
"`Behold the days come, says the Lord,
that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah;
not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that
I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt,
which covenant they broke, although I was a husband unto them, says the Lord:
but this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel;
after those days, says the Lord, I will put My law in their inward parts,
and write it in their hearts, and will be their God, and they shall be My people.
And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother,
saying, `'Know the Lord:'` for they shall all know Me, from the least of them,
unto the greatest of them, says the Lord; for I will forgive their iniquity,
and I will remember their sin no more,`" Jeremiah 31:31-34.

These and similar precious promises I was made willing to take hold of,
and waited for the fulfilling of them in myself,
and of that which Christ said to the Jews in John 6:45:
"`It is written in the prophets, and they shall be all taught of God.
Every man therefore that has heard, and has learned of the Father, comes unto Me.`"
He that comes unto Christ Jesus, the Light
that enlightens every man that comes into the world,
though their sins and their iniquities be great, shall in no way be cast out.
And it is said, "`and all your children shall be taught of the Lord,
and great shall be the peace of your children,`" Isaiah 54:13.

When I came to know a little of the teachings of the Lord,
I took my leave of all my former formal teachers,
and many times went to the woods and other by-places, where none might see me,
to wait upon the Lord, where I was much broken, and tendered by the power of God.
And though I did begin to see a little of myself, and something of the goodness of God,
yet still I was afraid of being deceived,
for I had read and heard that Satan himself is "`transformed
into an angel of light,`" 2 Cor. 11:14. And lest the Quaker man I conversed with
should prove to be as the same apostle said
in verse 13, "`For such are false apostles, deceitful workers,
transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ,`" I
desired of the Lord that I might see this poor man once again,
for I knew not where to see the face of any called a Friend.
It pleased God to send him that way again,
and I desired of my master and mistress to give him lodging,
and that he might be with me, to which they consented.
Then I queried of him their way of worship, and concerning those two great ordinances,
so called, that we so much relied upon, i.e. the Bread and Wine, and Baptism,
and also the Scriptures, to know what was their judgment of them;
to which he gave me some satisfaction.
In the morning I parted with him, and to the best of my knowledge,
I saw him no more for several years after.

All this time I still kept my retirement in the woods, or some other private place;
and there in my waiting, I desired of the Lord
that I might be further satisfied by Himself as to those things.
First, whether the scriptures themselves were the word of God
and the way to life and salvation, as it was said and preached unto us.
Then the first chapter of John came under my serious consideration in my meditation,
which said, "`In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God,
and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God.
All things were made by Him, and without Him nothing was made that was made.
In Him was life, and the life was the light of men; and the light shines in darkness,
and the darkness comprehended it not.`"
I considered that the Word was in the beginning with God the Father,
and that no part of the scriptures were written until the time of Moses,
who we understand was the first writer of those scriptures we have.
The apostle tells us here that "`the law was given by Moses,
but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.`" In this Word there was life; Paul tells us
that "`the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life;`"
now this life is the light of men, and the Word was before the scriptures were written.
By this we may see the Word of God is Christ Jesus,
who was with the Father before the world began;
"`without Him there was not anything made that was made.`"
The history that Moses gives us
is said to be written about 3000 years after the creation of the world;
therefore the scriptures cannot properly be the Word of God.

I, with many more, was under that mistake that the Jews were in,
who thought they might have eternal life in the scriptures; Christ says in John 5:39,
"`Search (or you search) the scriptures, for in them you think you have eternal life,
and they are they which testify of Me;
and you will not come to Me that you might have life.`"
As He is the life, so He is the way to the Father; "`I am the way, and the truth,
and the life:
no man comes unto the Father but by Me,`" John 14:6. As for the scriptures,
I was a great lover and reader of them,
and took great pleasure in the searching of them,
thinking that would make me wise unto salvation, as Paul said to Timothy;
"`And that from a child you have known the scriptures,
which are able to make you wise unto salvation, through faith,
which is in Christ Jesus,`" 2 Tim.
3:15. This main thing was lacking, the true and saving faith, which is the gift of God.
"`It is by grace we are saved through faith, not of ourselves,
it is the gift of God,`" Eph. 2:8. So it is the grace of God that brings salvation,
and not the bare historical knowledge of the scriptures.
Too many take a great deal of pride in a literal knowledge of them,
some for their gain and profit; others take pleasure in them,
by wresting them to vindicate their false and erroneous opinions
that gender strife and contention, and take little or no notice of that meek, holy,
and lovely spirit of life that gave them forth,
for they are of no private interpretation;
"`but holy men of God spoke them as they were moved by the Holy Spirit,`"
2 Pet. 1:20-21.

Men may have a great literal knowledge of the scriptures, and yet remain in error,
because they do not know them as they ought,
nor the power that was in the holy men that gave them forth. So I may say,
as Christ said to the Jews, "`You err, not knowing the scriptures,
nor the power of God,`" Matt. 22:29. So that which gives the true knowledge of God,
and a right understanding of the scriptures, is the power of God;
and I may say with the apostle, "`For God,
who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, has shined in our hearts,
to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God,
in the face of Jesus Christ,`" 2 Cor. 4:6.
And as men and women come to mind this light,
that is, the Spirit of God, and to obey it,
they shall come to the comfort of the scriptures, as the same apostle says,
"`For whatsoever things were written beforetime, were written for our learning;
that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope,`" Rom. 15:4.

And being under a serious consideration of what I read in the scripture,
believing the Spirit of the Lord to be the interpreter thereof,
those great mysteries that were hid from ages and generations,
(and are still hid from many in this age) come to be revealed by the Spirit of God.
And if men seek comfort in reading the scriptures,
they must wait in that measure of the Spirit which God has given them,
which is the only key that opens the scriptures to the understanding of
those who are truly conscientious in the reading of them.
Though I read them formerly (as many do now,
without a true sense and a due consideration), yet now I can bless God for them,
and have a great comfort in the reading of them,
they no longer being as a sealed book unto me, and many others,
who wait for the assistance of God`'s holy Spirit
in all their duties and performances that the Lord requires of them
(for without Him we know that we can do nothing that is pleasing unto Him).
And though formerly we ran in our own time and wills to preach and pray,
not having such a due regard to the leading and moving of the Spirit of the Lord, yet,
I bless God, it is not so now.
Many times, when I arose from my knees in a formal way of prayer,
a reproof was very near me, "`Who required this at your hands?
It is sparks of your own kindling.`"
I was afraid that I should "`lie down in sorrow,`" as was said to some by the Lord,
in Isaiah 50:11.

But as to this subject, I shall briefly conclude,
though much more might be said to the honour of the holy scriptures.
But this is my desire--that they who read them,
may come to that which will give them a right understanding thereof;
"`For there is a spirit in man,
and the inspiration of the Almighty gives them understanding,`" Job 32:8.

Now, I also had under consideration the subject of water baptism,
though I was no admirer of it, being not of the persuasion of re-baptizing.
Those called Independents were not very much for re-baptizing in the beginning,
but afterward it prevailed more among them in these parts,
when one Henry Jessy came here;
and it was about that time that I left them.
I had much reasoning and various consultations in my mind concerning this
and the bread and wine.
And when I was satisfied as to those weighty concerns, I thought I might rest there,
and keep my old customs and fashions, and language; but that would not do,
for I had no peace therein.
God showed me that the customs of the nation were vain,
and that our language was not according to the language of God`'s people,
recorded in the scriptures of truth.
So I made a conscientious search into this matter also,
where I found that the great Creator of heaven and earth,
who by the word of His power made all things therein, created man in His own image.
"`In the image of God He created him: male and female He created them.
And God blessed them,
and gave them dominion over all things that He had created on earth;
and Adam gave names to them.
And God took him, and put him in the garden of Eden, to dress it and to keep it.
And the Lord commanded the man, saying,
'`Of every tree of the garden thou may freely eat,`'`" Gen 2:15-16.
This is the first Thou spoken to man^
footnote:[Richard Davies is not
suggesting that God spoke to Adam using the English word "`thou`",
but rather that nowhere in the Bible, from the beginning to the end,
is an individual person addressed by God (or by anyone else)
using a plural pronoun, like "`you`" or "`your`".
See the footnote near the beginning of this journal respecting the use of "`plain language.`"]
that I read of in the scripture; and the great Creator said,
"`Everything that He had made was very good,`" Gen. 1:31.,
and His language to man was very good and pure.
Then again, when Adam transgressed the law and commandment of God,
"`the Lord God called unto Adam, and said unto him,
'`Where art thou?`'
And he said, '`I heard Thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid
because I was naked,`'`" Gen. 3:10-9.

Here was the language of God to man,
and the language of man to God.
And in the searching of the scriptures,
I found that all the holy men of God used that language,
and Christ taught His disciples to pray in that language: "`Our Father,
which art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name, Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.`"
Matt. 6.
And furthermore, I knew a little grammar, and that it was improper to say vos +++[+++you]
to one single person,
instead of tu +++[+++thou]. And though the learned in our nation spoke it,
yet I thought Christians should not use it, but should take the Spirit of God,
according to the scripture, to be their rule,
and not follow the confused language of the heathens. For the Lord,
by the mouth of His prophet, commanded His people:
"`Learn not the way of the heathen,--for the customs of
the people are vain,`" Jer. 10:2-3. I also believed
that the Lord would return to His people a pure language in these days,
as was promised in the days of old concerning Israel. Then,
when they returned to the Lord, He would bring them out of their captivity: "`For then,
says the Lord, will I turn to the people a pure language,
that they may all call upon the name of the Lord to serve Him with one consent.`"
Zeph. 3:9.

Thus I was conscientiously concerned to speak
the pure language of thee and thou to every one,
without respect of persons, which was a great cross to me.
Though it seems to some but as a weak and foolish thing,
yet when the Lord lays the necessity of speaking the truth to all
in that language that God and all His servants used,
it comes to be of a greater weight than many light and airy people think it is.
The sayings of Christ came to my mind, when He said, "`If any man will come after Me,
let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily,
and follow Me,`" Luke 9:23. He does not say He should do it, but let him do it,
imperatively, which was a command:
"`That we should deny ourselves and follow Him;`" see
also Matt. 16:24. And moreover it is said,
"`He that takes not his cross, and follows after Me, is not worthy of Me.`"
Matt. 10:38.

This necessity being laid upon me, I spoke to my master in that dialect;
he was not offended at it, because he was convinced of the truth of it,
and that it ought to be spoken to everyone. But when I spoke it to my mistress,
she took a stick and gave me such a blow upon my bare head,
that it swelled and was sore for a considerable time. She was so disturbed at it,
that she swore she would kill me, though she would be hanged for it.
The enemy had so possessed her that she was quite out of order;
though before this time she very seldom, if ever, spoke an angry word to me.
But I considered that the enmity was between the two seeds,
and that "`that which was born after the flesh
did persecute him that is born after the spirit.`"
Being well satisfied of the truth in myself, I remembered Christ`'s words,
"`He that loves father or mother more than Me, is not worthy of Me;
and he that loves son or daughter more than Me, is not worthy of Me;
and he that finds his life, shall lose it; and he that loses his life for My sake,
shall find it.`" Matt. 10:37,39.

The Almighty God put it into my heart to consider the cost,
and that through tribulation I was to enter the kingdom of heaven;
and I was faithful in this testimony that I had to bear.
I was much encouraged to go on in that strait and narrow way
that God showed me I was to walk in.
I also considered the saying of Christ, "`Whosoever does not bear his cross,
and come after Me, cannot be My disciple.`"
Again, "`For which of you, intending to build a tower,
does not sit down first and count the cost, whether he has enough to finish it--
lest, after he has laid the foundation, and is not able to finish it,
all who see it begin to mock him, saying, `'This man began to build,
but was not able to finish?`'`" Luke 14:27-30.

This consideration was weighty with me, lest I should begin to take up the cross,
and to walk in this way, and should not be able to hold out to the end--first,
because of the temptation of Satan, the lust of the flesh,
and the sinful customs and fashions of this world, which were very prevalent;
and also, because a great weight and burden were upon me,
having none in the country to be a help to me in the time of my exercise
but the Lord alone,
who has promised to be with His people in all their troubles and exercises,
and that He would not leave them nor forsake them.
I was very ready and willing to take hold of His promises, and my prayers
unto Him were that He would enable me to go through all things that He required.
I was sensible that without the assistance of His holy Spirit,
I could not perform that service which He required of me.

I was now first called a Quaker, because I said to a single person thee and thou,
and kept on my hat, and did not go after the customs and fashions of the world,
that other professors^
footnote:[At this time the word professor was used to refer to those who professed faith in Christ.
Here the word has nothing to do teachers or scholars.]
lived and walked in.
Though some of them would complain of their religious formalities,
and were weary of the fashions of the world, yet they did not take up their cross
and leave them.

The rage of my mistress was not yet abated, though she had nothing against me
except my not conforming to the corrupt language and vain customs of the world;
for I laboured to keep a conscience void of offence, both towards God and men.
I did my work and service honestly and justly, "`not with eye-service, as men-pleasers,
but in singleness of heart, as the servant of Christ,
doing the will of God from the heart,`" Eph. 6:5-6,
and ver. 8, "`Knowing that whatever good thing any man does,
the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether he is a slave or free.`"

In thus doing, I had great comfort from the Lord,
and received from Him living satisfaction and encouragement to go on in my way,
remembering the scripture that says, "`The righteous shall hold on his way,
and he that has clean hands shall be stronger and
stronger,`" Job 17:9. I might also say with Job,
"`But He knows the way that I take; when He has tried me, I shall come forth as gold:
my foot has held His steps; His way have I kept, and not declined;
neither have I gone back from the commandment of His lips:
I have esteemed the words of His mouth more than my
necessary food,`" Job 23:10-12. The Lord kept me,
and His people, very meek and low in our minds, in a self-denying spirit.
We waited for the living word, that came with a living voice,
from Him that speaks from heaven to us by His Spirit,
so that He gave discernment between the voice of wisdom
and the voice of the strange woman, which is the voice of the flesh,
and the lust thereof;
and the living voice is the voice of Christ in us the hope of glory,
which voice we esteemed more than our necessary food.
For obeying this voice, we came to be mocked and derided,
"`and they spoke all manner of evil against us,
and hated us for His name`'s sake,`" Matt. 10:22. I
remembered what Christ has told us in Luke 21:12,
"`They shall lay their hands on you, and persecute you,
delivering you up to the synagogues, and into prisons,
being brought before kings and rulers for My name`'s sake.
But it shall turn out for you as an occasion for testimony.
Settle it therefore in your hearts, not to meditate before what you shall answer;
for I will give you a mouth and wisdom,
which all your adversaries shall not be able to contradict nor resist,`" Luke 21:13-15.

These and similar afflictions I was to meet with
if I truly and faithfully followed the Lord Jesus Christ;
therefore I laboured to put on the whole armour of light,
that I might be able to withstand the fiery darts of the wicked one,
who sought to weaken my faith, and to persuade me of the hardness, straightness,
and narrowness of the way, that I should not be able to hold out to the end,
seeing there was not any in this country to help and assist me.

The fiery darts of the enemy that I felt came more by his servants than otherwise.
Very prevalent he was in this poor misled woman, my mistress,
who was persuaded by him to kill me, and shed innocent blood. And one time,
when she thought it a fit opportunity to execute her will and cruelty,
she fell into a great rage, and I was freely given up to die that hour by her hand;
but the Lord was pleased to accept of my free-will offering,
and I may say with the apostle, "`that I accounted not my life dear to myself,
that I might finish my course with joy.`"
And the Lord alone appeared to my deliverance,
and made her more moderate the rest of my servitude,
it being somewhat less than two years. And after I went away,
the Lord visited her with a sharp fit of sickness,
in which time she spoke to her husband and those that were with her,
saying that she thought she should not die till she had asked me forgiveness,
and desired them to send for me if it were at London; and so they did.
I could freely forgive her, for I had done so long before,
and I prayed to my heavenly Father that He might forgive her also.
I sent to her, and it pleased God to touch her with a sense of His love,
and lengthen her days;
she afterwards confessed often the wrong she had done to an honest and
careful young man, as she said I had been, who minded her and her husband`'s
inward and outward good
more than they did themselves.
It pleased God to order it so that she had a visit from me
before she went out of this world, and very comfortable and acceptable it was to her;
and in a little time she ended her days in peace,
and was buried in Friends`' burying place near Dolgelle in Merionethshire.

About this time, 1657, it was the great talk of the country that I had become a Quaker.
My parents were much concerned about me.
I was informed that the priest of Welch-pool, W. Longford, went to them and told them
that I had gone mad,
and that they should send for some learned men to come to me and restore me to my senses.
I had not yet been with my father nor mother,
but waited for freeness and clearness in myself, and then I went to see them.
In my way I visited an old friend of mine, a professor of Christianity,
and had a little opportunity to speak to him of the things of God,
and His goodness to me. And a young man, called David Davies,
was then convinced of the truth. This was on a seventh-day, in the afternoon.

When I was clear there, I went to Welch-pool to my parents.
It was a trouble to them to see that I did not, as formerly,
go down upon my knees to ask their blessing, and bow to them, and take off my hat.
My father soon turned his back upon me.
I had heard of his displeasure, and that he had said he would leave me nothing,
saying to my relations that they had expected to have had comfort in me,
but now they expected none, but that I would go up and down the country, crying "`Repent! Repent!`"
Now if my father would have cast me off upon such an account,
I was well persuaded it was for Christ`'s and the gospel`'s sake.
I remembered David`'s condition when he said, "`Hide not Your face far from me,
put not Your servant away in anger. You have been my help, leave me not,
neither forsake me, O God of my salvation; when my father and my mother forsake me,
then the Lord will take me up: teach me Your way, O Lord, and lead me in a plain path,
because of my enemies,`" Ps. 27:9-11.

At length my mother came tenderly to me, and looking on my face,
she saw that I was her child, and that I was not, as they said,
bewitched or transformed into some other likeness, which was reported of Quakers then,
and that they bewitched people to their religion, etc.
Thus they deceived them and many others with such strange stories,
and we were accounted, with the apostles, deceivers, yet true.
And when I discoursed with her out of the scriptures,
her heart was much tendered and affected with the goodness of God towards me.
She went to look for my father, and when she found him, said unto him, "`Be of good comfort,
our son is not as was reported of him, we hope to have comfort of him yet.`"
But when my father came to his house, he spoke not much to me that night.

The next day, being the first day of the week, when I heard the bells ring,
it came upon me to go to the steeple-house
to visit that priest that had told my father I had gone mad, etc.
And when he was at his worship,
I went to our own seat by my father.
There was no common-prayer read then to the people
as part of their worship in those days. There I sat still till he had finished,
and when he had spoken what he had then to say,
I stood up and told him that he might do well to stay,
and make good the false doctrine that he had preached that day, if he could.
And if I was mad, as he reported,
that he might labour to restore me to my right senses again.
But I had spoken but a little while before I was taken away to prison
with the young man before mentioned, David Davies, who came to look for me,
and found me in the steeple-house. So both of us were taken,
and there we were prisoners that night,
in which time many came to see us from far and near,
expecting that we were some deformed creatures.
God gave me a seasonable exhortation to them to fear the Lord, and indeed to cry,
"`Repent, repent, for the kingdom of heaven was at hand;`" letting them know,
"`that we were God`'s workmanship,
created anew in Christ Jesus;`" with much more to that effect.
I spoke to them from the scripture, which was much to their satisfaction,
and we praised God, that kept us in His fear and counsel.

We were committed to prison according to the law made in Oliver`'s days,
that none were to speak to the priest or preachers, neither at their worship,
nor coming and going.
The next morning we were summoned before the
chief magistrate of the town of Welch-pool,
and after some discourse with him, it seemed good to him to discharge us,
for he could find nothing justly to accuse us of, except concerning the law of our God.

So we went to our homes, the young man to his father`'s, and I to my master`'s.
He suffered much violence by his father,
for he could not conform himself to that dry, dead,
and formal praying that his father used.
His father rose from off his knees when he was at prayer, and took a staff,
and did violently beat his son, and against natural affection he took a lock and chain,
and chained him out of doors in a cold, frosty night.
Thus our sufferings began to increase,
for the testimony of our consciences towards God;
"`but blessed be the name of the Lord, who preserved
His people that trusted in Him,`" says my soul.

A short time after this, I came to hear that some of
the people that were called Quakers were at Shrewsbury in the county of Salop,
about eighteen miles from the place of my abode.
I waited for an opportunity to go to see them and the way of their worship,
for as yet I had not seen any of them but that one poor man before-mentioned.
When the time called Christmas came, my master`'s work being somewhat over for a while,
I got permission to go so far.
I went first to the house of John Millington, where many Friends resorted,
and they of the town came to see me in great love and tenderness,
and much brokenness of heart was among us, though but few words.
We waited to feel the Lord among us in all our comings together.

When the first-day of the week came,
we went to a meeting at W. Pane`'s, at the Wild Cop,
where we had a silent meeting; and though it was silent from words,
yet the Word of the Lord was among us.
It was a hammer and a fire, sharper than any two-edged sword;
it pierced through our inward parts, and melted and brought us into tears,
so that there was scarcely a dry eye among us.
The Lord`'s blessed power overshadowed our meeting, and I could have said
that God alone was master of that assembly.

The next day as I was preparing for home,
having spent a considerable time with Friends there,
and being much comforted with the goodness of God and unfeigned love of the brethren,
we heard that John ap John had come to town, and was to have a meeting there.
I attended that meeting, where I heard the first Friend that was called a Quaker
preach in a meeting, and when I heard him, I thought he spoke as one having authority,
and not as the Scribes, his words were so sound and piercing.

After this meeting at Shrewsbury, I came home to my master`'s house,
where I was under many considerations, especially that of Christ`'s words,
"`You are the light of the world.
A city that is set on a hill cannot be hid.
Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick,
and it gives light unto all that are in the house.
Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works,
and glorify your Father which is in heaven.`" Matt. 5:14-16.

I was sensible that God had opened my understanding and lit my candle,
and given me a sense and feeling of my own state and condition--
how I had been in darkness, and under the region and shadow of death.
And God having showed mercy and kindness unto me,
in calling me from this great darkness to the
marvellous light of His dear Son Christ Jesus,
who is "`the light of the world,
that enlightens every man that comes into the world;`"
I was made willing not to hide my candle,
as it were under a bushel, or to hide my talent in the earth; but in the love of God,
I was made willing to let that light, which He
pleased by His grace to enlighten me with, shine before men, that they might come
"`to glorify their Father, which is in heaven.`" Matt. 5:16.

The next public service that the Lord required of me
was to go and give my testimony for Him,
and to warn a company of people to consider their latter end,
who had met together to dance and to play at what they called a merry night,
not far from my master`'s house.
When I came within the room where they were dancing, the fiddler ceased playing,
and they dancing, and I declared the word of the Lord among them.
That which was chiefly before me was that saying of Job;
"`They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their children dance.
They take the timbrel and harp, and rejoice at the sound of the organ.
They spend their days in mirth,
and in a moment go down to the grave,`" Job 21:11-13.
When I had discharged myself of what lay upon me,
I parted in love and peace from them, and they thanked me for my good exhortation,
and some of them came to see me home.

About this time, 1658, I heard of one that was called a Quaker
who had come from Ireland to Llanvilling, a town in the county of Montgomery,
and in the love of God I went upon the first-day of the week to visit him.
We had a comfortable and refreshing meeting together,
and the Lord`'s presence was with us, and though we were strangers one to another
as to the outward,
yet we had fellowship and unity one with another in the inward life of righteousness;
his name was Roger Pritchard.
He tarried not long there, but returned again to Ireland, though it was said
he came to these parts with an intention to stay here
and to bear his testimony for God in this dark corner of North Wales;
but he not being faithful to God, who sent him here,
he suffered great losses by sea as he was going back,
and lost his good condition also,
and turned back to the vanities of the world,
which was a great sorrow and exercise to me. But the Lord visited him again,
as may be seen hereafter.
Thus I was left alone again.

I continued, as the Lord made way for me,
to visit those in whom I found any inclination to the things that were good,
and there was one William Davies who was convinced of the truth with me.
I was also made willing to visit the Independent meeting
and those people that I formerly belonged to, who were a separate people,
gathered together chiefly by Vavasor Powell,
before-mentioned--a zealous man in his day. But when truth broke forth in this country,
and I being the first that came to receive it in these parts,
I separated myself from them, in love to that blessed truth that
I received, and it became my true teacher.
So Vavasor Powell proved angry, and preached much against the Quakers,
their way and principles. Upon hearing this, I came to a place called Cloddieocochon,
near Welch-pool, to their meeting, expecting to find him there; but he was not there.
John Griffithes, a justice of the peace in those days, was preaching there.
When I came in among them, they seemed uneasy; and when I had an opportunity,
I bore a testimony for God, His Son Christ Jesus, and His way, truth, and people,
which they preached against.
When I had spoken what I had to say, he continued speaking,
and when I found something more upon my spirit to declare among them,
this John Griffithes commanded to have me taken away, and a near relation of mine,
who owned the house, took me in his arms and led me out of the house, through the fold,
and through a gate that opened to the common, shutting the gate after me.

There I sat under an ash tree, weeping and mourning to see the blindness, darkness,
hardness of heart, pride and haughtiness
that had come over a people who once were loving, kind, and humble in spirit.
As I sat weightily under a serious consideration of
what and when would be the end of these formalities and hardness of heart,
I prayed to the Lord for them.
And the word of the Lord came to me, that though they put me out of their house,
yet in time they would come to acknowledge the truth,
and that house should be a meeting-place for Friends.
Of this a further account may be seen hereafter.

So I went away, well satisfied of the love and goodness of God to me that day,
in giving me comfort and consolation for my tears of sorrow and affliction
that I met with a little before; and I remembered the saying of the apostle,
Heb. 12:11, "`Now no chastening for the present seems to be joyous, but grievous;
nevertheless, afterward it yields the peaceable fruit of righteousness,
unto them which are exercised thereby.`"

After this, I still waited to know the will and counsel of God,
that He might direct me in my way and order my steps in my spiritual travail;
for I had none to look to but to Him alone,
who was all-sufficient to carry on the work which He had begun, though often by weak,
poor, low, and contemptible instruments in the eyes of the world.
Well might I say with the apostle,
"`But God has chosen the foolish things of the world to put to shme the wise,
and God has chosen the weak things of the world
to put to shame the things which are mighty; and base things of the world
and things which are despised, God has chosen, and things which are not,
to bring to nothing the things that are,`" 1 Cor. 1:27-28.

About this time, I went to visit some young men
who were my former companions in the profession of religion;
two or three of them were convinced,
and received the Truth.
When we had reached four, I felt within me
that we ought to meet together in the name of the Lord,
for I remembered the promise of Christ, who said,
"`Where two or three are gathered together in My name,
there am I in the midst of them,`" Matt. 18:20.

So we all agreed to meet together, but none of us had a house of his own to meet in.
We determined therefore to meet upon a hill in a common,
as near as we could for the conveniency of each other,
we living some miles distant from one another.
There we met in silence, to the wonder of the country.
When the rain and weather beat upon us on one side of the hill, we went to the other side.
We were not free to go into any of the neighbours`' enclosures, for they were so blind,
dark, and ignorant, that they looked upon us as witches, and would go away from us,
some crossing themselves with their hands about their foreheads and faces.

Thus we continued for some time, till two of them left me;
one of them was bound as an apprentice by Friends to William Shewen, of London.
The other young man was a soldier in Oliver Cromwell`'s days, and
as soon as he could, he got dismissed from service, and so went to Gloucestershire
and lived among Friends.
The third was one William Davies, who lived close to me,
and we met together for some time; but one time he stayed longer than usual,
and a foul and dark spirit possessed him, so that the little time we were together
was not comfortable to me. And when we had broken up the meeting by way of discourse,
he asked me how I thought we would be able to stand in the face of the whole country.
I answered him with great zeal, "`The Serpent, the Serpent,
the same that beguiled the woman in Paradise, has beguiled you;
you will not be able to stand.`"
And while we were yet discoursing, I saw my master coming,
who was also convinced,
but was not faithful to that good Spirit that convinced him of the truth.
The Spirit showed him what he ought to do, but he did it not;
yet he continued loving to Friends, and frequented their meetings to his latter end.

As I looked back, I saw him coming towards us, with two women following him;
the one was his wife (my cruel mistress),
the other was the sister of one of my companions,
both of whom had wooden staffs in their hands.
When they came up to us, the sister began to beat her brother,
and my master and mistress fell to beating William Davies.
So his trial came very quickly, and William Davies came no more to meet me,
nor any other Friends, for many years; yet he afterwards came among Friends,
and continued with them to the end of his days, and was buried among them.
It so happened that I never received a blow from them, and if I had received any,
I had learned of Christ Jesus, my Lord and master,
to suffer patiently for His name`'s sake, and not to depart from Him, though my trials,
temptations and afflictions were not a few; so that I may say with the apostle,
"`But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself,
so that I might finish my course with joy.`" Acts 20:24.
2 Cor. 4:17. Matt. 10:37-39.

These young men going their separate ways as above described,
I was left alone again,
but still I continued waiting upon the Lord, to know His will and
good pleasure concerning me; and when the time of my apprenticeship
was over, I found freedom to go to London,
to visit Friends there, which was in the year 1658-9.
And finding many good and living Friends there, I settled into my trade,
being a felt maker, and I was very well satisfied, being able to go to meetings,
and follow my business.
When anything would come into my mind of my native country,
barren and uninhabited with Friends and Truth, I endeavoured to shut it out,
and to continue where I was. I continued in this way for a time,
but all my fair pretences and reasonings would not do. I was disobedient to the
Lord, and trouble and sorrow and judgment from the Lord came upon me
for not obeying His command to go to my own country,
and to stand a witness for Him there. I continued in my
disobedience till I lost His presence,
and He smote me with trouble within and pain in my bones,
so that I could not work nor labour.

In this time Friends of London were very kind and careful over me,
and would freely have administered help,
but I was not willing to accept anything from them so long as I had resources of my own.
My pain of body and spirit increased upon me
till at last I was forced to bow to the will of the great God, who was too strong for me;
and reasoning with Him one night, upon the bed of my sorrows, He showed me clearly
that I was to go to my own country; and I was made willing to give up to go,
if He would be pleased to let me know His will and pleasure by this sign and token,
that He would remove my pain.
I also reasoned with Him thus--that I was alone, like a pelican in the wilderness,
or a sparrow on a house top.
The Lord still commanded me to go, showing that He would provide a help-mate for me.
And when I had made a covenant with the Lord to go, immediately my pain was removed,
and I had peace and quietness of mind and spirit.
I arose the next morning, and went to my work; and when those tender Friends
who had a regard for me in my sickness came to see me that morning,
I had gone to work,
which was to their admiration.

So the Lord gave me a little time, and He alone provided a help-mate for me;
for I prayed unto Him that she might be of His own providing,
for it was not yet manifest to me where she was, or who she was.
But one time, as I was at Horselydown meeting in Southwark,
I heard a woman Friend open her mouth
by way of testimony against an evil, ranting spirit that
opposed Friends much in those days.
It was revealed to me by the Lord that that woman was to be my wife,
and she was to go with me to the country, and be a help-mate to me.
After meeting, I drew somewhat near to her, but spoke nothing,
nor made any acquaintance with her, nor did I know when or where I would see her again.
I was very willing to let the Lord order it as it seemed best to Himself,
and therein I had peace of mind; and in time the Lord brought
us into acquaintance with one another,
and she confessed that she had some sight of the
same thing that I had seen concerning her.
So after some time we parted, and I was freely resigned to the will of God;
and when we came together again, I told her that if the Lord so ordered her to be my wife,
she must come with me to a strange country,
where there were no Friends, beside what God in time might
call and gather to Himself. Upon a little consideration,
she said that if the Lord should order it so, she must go with her husband,
even if it were into the wilderness;
and being somewhat sensible of the workings of God upon her spirit in this matter,
she was willing to condescend in her mind to what He wrought in her.
But by hearkening to one who had not well weighed the matter,
she became disobedient to what God had revealed to her,
which brought great sorrow and trouble upon her.
I went to see her in this poor condition,
and I rested satisfied with the will of God in this concern, being freely resigned,
if the Lord had wrought the same thing in her as was in me,
to receive her as His gift to me. And after some time,
we waiting upon the Lord together, she arose and declared before me,
and the other Friend who had planted doubts and reasonings in her mind,
that in the name and power of God she consented to be my wife, and to go along with me
wherever the Lord should order us; and I said, in the fear of the Lord,
"`I receive you as the gift of God to me.`"
So I rested satisfied in the will of God for a further accomplishment of it.

Under the weighty consideration of the manner in which we should take each other in marriage,
we concluded to lay our proceedings before our elders,
and especially our ancient friend George Fox.
People in those days were married by a priest,
or before a justice, but I told George Fox
we desired to be married in a public meeting;
and he desired the Lord to be with us.
And when we found clearness in the Lord to proceed,
we went to the Snail meeting in Tower Street,
London, in the morning; and in the afternoon to Horselydown, Southwark.
And in that meeting, being the 26th of the fourth month, 1659, in the presence of God
and the assembly, we took each other to be man and wife.

God alone knew our innocency and integrity in joining together.
It was not for gold nor silver, nor any outward thing,
but to be serviceable to Him in our age and generation,
and to stand witnesses for Him and His blessed truth wherever He would send us.
I might say with Tobias, "`You made Adam, and gave him Eve his wife,
for a helper and a stay; of them came mankind.
You have said, It is not good that man should be alone,
let us make an aid like himself,`" Tobit 8:6.

Soon after, in the Lord`'s time, we made what haste we could to come to the country,
where we believed the Lord desired us to be; and we said, "`O Lord,
if You will go with us in our way, and give us bread to eat,
and raiment to put on, then, O Lord, You shall be our God;`"
and the Lord was with us during all of our journey,
and gave us His sweet and comfortable presence.

Soon after we came to Welch-Pool,
the professors who had been in great power
began to be fainthearted because of the report of bringing in king Charles the second,
which in a little time was accomplished, and those that were in great pomp
were brought to prison themselves.
I was brought before the first justices that were made in
these parts by the authority of king Charles the second,
in the year 1660, notwithstanding I was a prisoner to the magistrate of the town.
When I went up before them, many of the people of the town followed me
to see what would become of me, and to what prison they would send me,
or what punishment they would inflict upon me.
But the Lord was with me, and I feared not man, whose breath is in his nostrils,
but the living God, whom I desired to obey in all things.

When I had come into the room (it being in the night),
the high sheriff, colonel Mostyn, and the justices stood in amazement
to see me come in among them with my hat on my head,
and spoke not one word to me for some time.
In a little while, I asked them whether they sent for me there; they said they did.

One of the justices asked me where I had acquired that new way and strange religion.
I told him it was the good old way which I had found,
the same that the prophets and servants of God lived and walked in,
and I desired to walk in it all my days.
The justice was peevish, and said, "`I think the man is mad,
I think we must have him whipped;`" and though I answered them according to scripture,
they were ignorant of it.
They demanded that I take the oath of allegiance and supremacy; I told them
that my Lord and Master, Christ Jesus, and His apostle James,
commanded me not to swear at all.
They had a priest with them who took it upon himself to question me.
The first thing he asked me was, "`Which was first, reason or scripture?`" I told him
that reason was before scripture; God made man a reasonable creature in His own image,
and the first part of the scriptures now extant was written by Moses.
The apostle tells us, "`That the law came by Moses,
but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.`"
I further told them,
"`that holy men of God gave them forth as they were moved by the Holy Spirit.`"
As to this, they seemed to be satisfied.

But the priest began to ask me some ensnaring questions, and when I perceived it,
I asked the justices who this man was,
whether he was a justice of the peace or not,
or whether he was only a priest. They said
they considered him to be a fitter man than
themselves to discourse with me about religion.
I told them I thought he was as the high-priest among the Jews,
who asked Christ ensnaring questions when He was brought before them,
to seek to make Him an offender. And turning to the justices,
I desired them to take notice of that man who asked those ensnaring questions
to seek to make me an offender.

Then the priest left me, and the justices asked me, seeing I would not take the oaths,
whether I would give bail; and said
they would take my father`'s bail for my good behaviour.
I told them, "`My cause is just, and I am innocent, and will give you no bail,
for truth binds me to my good behaviour.`"
Then the high-sheriff, a very fair man, told me I was a strange man,
and of a strange persuasion, to come with my hat upon my head among them,
and not take the oaths nor give bail.
"`You know,`" said he, "`that Paul said to Festus, '`Noble Festus.`'`"
I told him that Paul had tried Festus, but I had not yet tried him;
and it may be, that after I had tried him, I might say to him "`Noble Sheriff;`"
and upon saying this most of them seemed very pleasant.
He asked me who I knew there. There were several justices present
who were my relations, and who knew me very well,
but I made mention of none of them, but told them
I knew the chief magistrate of the town, Charles Jones, whose prisoner I was.
Then they called for him, and asked him whether or not he knew me;
he said he did, very well, for I was born and bred in the town among them,
and was a very honest young man in all my ways. "`But,`" said he,
"`what devil he has now, I know not.`"
They asked him whether I was his prisoner or not; he said I was.
"`Then,`" said the justices, "`take him again into your custody.`"

As I was going out of the room, I told them
that I had come there wearing a good hat on my head,
but was going away without it, for some people of the baser sort
had taken it away. But the justices made diligent search for it,
so that it was brought to me again,
and put upon my head, and they parted with me in much friendliness,
and the town magistrate pulled me aside,
and bid me go home to my wife and family.
Many of the inhabitants of the town accompanied me home,
praising God on their way for my deliverance,
for several things were threatened against me; but, blessed be God, truth was over all,
and had dominion. And the witness of God was reached in many of them,
and the high-sheriff continued loving and kind to Friends,
and ready to serve them in what way he could all his life-time,
as was his deputy-sheriff, and several of the other justices.

About the third month, 1660, many of the professors, captains, lieutenants,
and soldiers that were in arms in Oliver`'s and Richard Cromwell`'s days,
were put in prison in the town of Montgomery.
My wife and I foresaw that I would be sent there with them,
though I was never a soldier, nor bore any arms for either side.
And in a little time a troop of horsemen came for me, to bring me to prison.
My relations offered to give bail for me, but it was not accepted,
so I went to inform my wife of it, and to make myself ready to go with them.
One of the soldiers came up the stairs after me, with a pistol and an unsheathed sword,
and my wife raising herself up and sitting in bed,
(she having been confined to bed but three days before
with the birth of her first child), she said,
"`Dear husband be faithful to God, whatever becomes of me.`"
The soldier, seeing her, retreated back.
So I went down to the troop of horsemen standing in the street before my house.
There was one bad man among them, who had run away while in debt to my father,
that threatened to compel me to follow his horse`'s heels on foot many miles.
But by this time several of the aldermen and others of the town
were gathered together in the street, who desired this man, and others of the troop,
to leave me alone for that time, saying they would engage, body for body,
that I would be in prison next morning; but they could not prevail.
At length some of the aldermen fell into a rage,
and bid the soldiers to meddle with me if they dared, and told me to go to my house,
which I was not willing to do, for great fear came upon me
lest there should be a quarrel among them concerning my going or staying.
But one or two of the aldermen, being more considerate than the rest,
desired the troop to wait till the captain might be spoken with,
who was then in town.
He soon granted that I should stay at home that night,
and be in Montgomery prison next morning,
and was angry at that bad man for his incivility
towards the aldermen that interceded for me;
for the captain knew I was a peaceable man,
and never concerned myself in fighting for one side or the other.
When the troop had their orders, they went on their way; and I praised God,
in the multitude of His mercies, that there was no blood shed that day;
for many of the young men of the town, as well as the aldermen,
were gathered together with clubs and staffs, saying,
"`What! Should a child born in this town be so abused by such
a bad fellow?`" My heart at various times trembled within me,
lest any violence should be committed in
this tumult; and I requested of them many times,
before they went to speak with the captain,
that they might let me go along with the troop to prison.

So that night I stayed at home,
and the next morning made my journey towards the prison at Montgomery.
On my way I avoided the house of my uncle, a justice of the peace in this county,
and brother-in-law to the captain before-mentioned,
lest he should stop me from going to prison.

So I went there alone, and told the marshal, John Mason,
that I had come as prisoner; and he took me up to an upper garret for my lodging.
But I had freedom of the whole house, as did the other prisoners,
there being many Presbyterians, Independents, and Baptists,
who were formerly my close acquaintances; but now they appeared very strange,
and would not discourse with me.
I wondered at the reason for this, and was informed
that these old, formal church-members or professors had agreed
among themselves that they would not discourse with me,
nor receive any books from me,
lest the most serious and inward Christians among them should turn Quakers.
But in a little time their orders and covenants were broken,
and I was moved by the Lord to go to their meetings,
sometimes having little to say among them
but a sigh or a groan, and a travail in my spirit for them,
which often put them out of order in their preaching and praying;
and as the Lord ordered it, I at times would speak a few words among them.
A Baptist was convinced there, and came to meet with me in my room.

Cadwalader Edwards was also convinced, and came up to meet with us in the prison;
and then discourses and disputes began between them and me.
I wrote a few lines to send home to my wife, but knew not by whom to send it,
for it was very hard to send any papers out of prison. The marshal, or jailer,
would examine and search any who came in, or went out, for letters.
An old friend, an acquaintance of mine,
came to visit her friends and brethren (the professors) in prison,
and I desired her to carry the letter to my wife
as she went through our town of Welch-pool, towards her home.
She was afraid to meddle with it, partly for fear of the jailer,
and also lest she should offend her brethren there.
I desired her not to be afraid, for I would read it to her first,
and the jailer could see it if he pleased. And after I had read it to her,
she was tenderly affected, and turning to her brethren, she said,
"`Surely these people will never come to us, but we must go to them.`"
Some time after, through much trouble and affliction, she came to receive the truth,
and to live in it and obey it. Her name was Margaret Bowen,
wife of John Bowen of Colfryn, and mother to Peter Bowen,
in Martin`'s-le-Grand, London.

In a little time, my service was over among the professors in that prison,
and the Lord made way for my freedom.
In about two weeks I was set at liberty, and left the rest of the prisoners there,
where they continued a considerable time.
I was well satisfied with the goodness of God, in that I found His presence, life,
and power with me--a present help in the time of need--which kept me low and humble,
so that I dared not rejoice in those still under bondage, but rather rejoice
that I found my name written in heaven.
I came home in great love and peace to my wife and family,
and many of my loving neighbours rejoiced to see me.

After this I continued about my calling and business,
and waited upon God to know His mind and will concerning me.
I heard of an honest old woman
who had received the truth some time before at Montgomery. Her name was Ann Hamon,
wife of Thomas Hamon; and my wife and I went to visit her.

About the year 1661, I went to a meeting at Edgemont, near Wem, in Shropshire.
Here our friend William Gibson and I were taken prisoners,
with about twenty-five or twenty-six more, and sent to Shrewsbury.
We found the temper of the jailer to be very cruel.
He threatened us with a great deal of hardship if we
did not eat his food, drink his drink, lie on his beds, and give him what he demanded.
We told him we were the king`'s prisoners, and demanded a free prison,
and straw to lie upon; but he in a rage would not permit it,
and put us in a little room,
where there was scarcely room for us to lie down.
When night came, sleep came upon us, we being weary after
travelling so many miles on foot,
but we were made willing and able to suffer all things;
so that night we lay upon the boards,
and it was pleasant to us, being warm weather,
and about the time of hay-harvest.

The next morning we were very fresh and well,
praising God for His mercies and goodness to us. When the jailer came to us and asked
how we liked our lodging, and how we slept, we told him
we slept in peace of conscience and quietness of mind,
for we suffered for conscience-sake towards God,
and dared not break the command of Christ and the apostle,
who commanded us not to swear at all (for our supposed transgression
was not only for meeting together,
but for refusing to take the oaths of allegiance and supremacy).
The jailer being a very passionate and inconsiderate man,
he would depart in the morning from his house and not come back till night,
and then returned so drunken, that he could hardly speak or stand.

The next night when we went to lie down,
there was so little room we could not all lie at once.
The next morning we complained to the jailer
that there was not enough room for us all to lie down,
and desired him to let us have a little straw; but it would not be granted us.
By this time the Friends of the town had liberty to come to visit us,
and to bring us some provision.
And when way was made for us to go into another room,
where there was a bedstead with cords,
William Gibson and I went in and laid upon the cords; and the next morning we found
that the print of the cords was not only on our clothes,
but on our skin also, so that it would have been easier for us to have lain upon the boards,
as we did before.

By this time, having well observed the jailer`'s humour and temper,
I began to be uneasy in myself for keeping silent concerning him.
So I watched him in the morning upon his first rising,
when he came to the court before our prison door,
and began to discourse with him about the prisoners that lay in such hardship.
I told him they were honest men, and most of them masters of families,
and had good beds to lie upon at home,
but now they were content for Christ`'s and the gospel`'s sake,
to suffer that hardship. I desired him to let them have
liberty to go to their friends in town at night,
and to return in the morning;
and if he wasn`'t willing to grant them a little straw,
then to let them go lie in their own beds; which he roughly denied,
calling them a company of rogues and knaves, and such like terms.
He asked me what compelled me to plead for them. I told him they were my friends.
He answered, "`Why your friends? You are no Quaker, are you?`"
I said, "`I am called a Quaker.`"
He answered, "`You do not look like a Quaker;`" and he looked me in the face,
and at my hands and body.
I desired him not to disgrace me so, as to tell me I was no Quaker.
Then he asked me where I lived; I told him that when I was at home,
I lived at Welch-pool, and my family was there.
"`But,`" said he, "`where are you now?`"
I asked him whether he knew that I also was a prisoner there with my friends;
and he asked me whether I slept upon the boards with them; I told him I did.
He said he was sorry for it, but went away in anger, being much discontented in himself.

I did not see him again till next morning, at which time I went to him again,
and discoursed kindly with him. He said he had enquired about me in town,
and that I might have the liberty of the town if I wished.
I acknowledged his kindness, but told him it would be no comfort to me
to have the liberty of the town, and leave my friends and brethren there in prison.
He said, "`Then you may stay there in the prison with them.`"
So I did not see him till the next morning, and then I went to him again.
He was in such a cross and bitter condition,
that he would not allow any other Friend to speak to him.
William Gibson condemned him for his wickedness,
for which he kept him closely confined in a room by himself.
After five or six nights of lying on the boards, I prevailed with him
that Friends might have the liberty of the town for the night,
and return to prison in the morning.
So the next day he began to be more friendly to us.

After some days,
I desired our friend John Millington to come with me to the jailer`'s house,
to see whether we could be granted the permission
to go home till the next court session; but it was not then granted,
although he told me that if I pleased I might go home till then.
I told him he might as freely let them go as me, for most of them lived in the county,
and I lived out of the county; but we could get nothing more from him at that time.
Seeing he had a regard for me, I felt uneasy in myself to let it drop,
and so continued to press for my friends`' further liberty.

A little time afterwards, by the argument that it was harvest time,
and hard for the mens`' wives, or some of their families,
to obtain their weekly necessities, I, with my friend John Millington,
prevailed with him to let us go,
he taking our word that we would appear at the next court session.

Through the goodness of God, we all returned together to our prison at Shrewsbury
before the court session, and found a great alteration in the jailer;
he was very low and mournful.
He had lost a prisoner, a malefactor, and was to be tried for his life for his escape.
He was very loving and kind to us, and let Friends go alone to Bridgenorth,
a distance of about fourteen miles, where the court sessions were then held;
and he desired me to stay with him in his affliction, and not be much absent from him.
He said his life was at stake, and if God and the judge would show him any mercy,
it was upon our Friends`' account, and not for any goodness that was in himself,
for he confessed he had been too severe to us; "`but notwithstanding,`" said he,
"`you are merciful men, and can forgive wrongs and injuries.`"

When we came to Bridgenorth,
we were put in a large, spacious room in the house of correction,
in order to be there during the day time,
that we might all be together and ready when called for;
but we had the liberty to go in and out for lodging and what necessaries we needed,
no keeper being over us but those which we set ourselves to watch the door,
to ensure that too many Friends might not be out at once,
and that those who were out would not be out too long.
We saw it was safer that Friends go out in groups of two to walk the streets;
for it was a strange thing to people to hear of Quakers.

Once it fell to my lot to be at the door. The door was always open,
so that those who desired to do so
might come and see us (with several of whom we had reasonings and
disputes about the way of truth and righteousness). While I was at the door,
there came one
who appeared somewhat like a gentleman, and asked me whether he might see the Quakers;
I bade him follow me to our room, and he would see them.
When I had brought him up to the room where Friends were walking, I told him
these were they.
He answered, "`These are Christians like ourselves, but where are the Quakers?`"
I told him these were they that were called Quakers.
He asked me whether I was one of them; I told him yes, I was called by that name.
I had an opportunity to declare to him the way of truth,
and that the name of Quaker was given to us in scorn and derision;
and he departed very friendly.

Some people were so blind and dark in those days,
that they viewed us as being some strange creatures,
and not like other men and women.
They would gather about us in the town,
and we had good opportunities to speak of the things of God to them.
But I was often with the jailer, waiting for the time of his trial; and when it came,
I went with him, and stood somewhat near him, which he was very glad of.
The jury cleared him, not finding him guilty of a willful escape,
which made him glad, and us satisfied.
And when the court session was nearly at an end,
the judge returned us to one named justice Holland, all except William Gibson.
He was asked by the judge whether he would go home if he were discharged,
and not being able to make the judge such a promise as he required,
he was committed again to the same prison.
But we were freely and friendly discharged,
having had good service in that town, and the Lord was with us, and brought us safely home,
to the comfort of our families and ourselves;
and we have cause to bless and praise the name of the Lord forever,
for all His mercies and goodness to us all along
in the time of our afflictions and persecutions.
We could say, "`Surely God is good to Israel,
and unto all them that draw near unto Him with an upright heart.`"

In the year 1662, a further concern came upon me about meeting in this country.
One who was convinced in the prison of Montgomery when I was there,
named Cadwalader Edwards, who lived near Dolobran,
promised me that we should have his house to keep a meeting in.
I went to him to know whether he would perform his promise, which he readily granted;
and I appointed the day and time with him,
which he gave notice of to his neighbours thereabouts.
Being destitute of a friend to accompany me to the meeting, I depended upon the Lord
to provide a suitable companion to go with me.
And as my wife was going to Shrewsbury, I told her of the meeting,
and desired her to speak to Friends there of it,
telling her that if there was any public Friend there, he might come home with her.

While there, she happened to come across Richard Moor, of Salop,
a worthy and faithful labourer in the gospel,
who returned with her to our house in Welch-Pool.
This was in the ninth month, 1662.
A day or two after, we went to the meeting,
to which came Charles Lloyd of Dolobran, who was formerly in commission of the peace,
and had been in election to be high-sheriff of that county
along with several of his well-meaning neighbours (some of whom were professors,
belonging to the same people that I formerly belonged to).
During this meeting the Lord did not fail us, but afforded unto us His good presence.
Life and power came from Him,
so that many of the hearts and understandings of those present were reached,
and these gave testimony to the truth, life, and power of God
that appeared with us at that time; and in the love, fear, and life of truth, we parted.

The next morning we went to visit Charles Lloyd, of Dolobran, who tenderly received us.
Several that had been at the meeting came there that day, where we had a sweet,
comfortable, refreshing time, in the presence of the Lord; as it is said,
"`In His presence is fulness of joy,
and at His right hand there are pleasures forevermore.`" Ps. 16:11.

The report of this meeting spread through the country, some saying
that most of that side of the country had turned Quakers;
whereupon many were summoned by Edward Lord Herbert, Baron of Cherbury,
to the place where he then lived, called Llyssin, about three miles from Dolobran.
After some discourse with them, he sent them to Welch-Pool to prison
for refusing to take the oath of allegiance and supremacy, which they had refused
because they could not swear at all.
They were about six sent together to prison,
namely, Charles Lloyd, Hugh David, Richard David, Cadwalader Edwards, Anne Lawrence,
Sarah Wilson, etc., where they were kept very close prisoners.

In a little time, William Lewis and Margaret his wife were added to this number.
These were the owners of the house at Cloddiecochion, before-mentioned,
where I was moved to go, about the year 1657, to a meeting of the professors,
which afterwards became the place of my abode.
This William Lewis, my close relation,
was the one that had led me out of the house to the common,
and shut the gate behind me, as was before related.
And thus the word of the Lord was fulfilled that came to me then,
that those people would acknowledge and receive the truth,
and that that house would be a meetinghouse for us (which it now is,
and has been these forty years).

The oath of allegiance and supremacy being tendered to them,
they could not take it for conscience-sake,
being forbidden by Christ and his apostle James to swear at all;
so they were sent to prison, and continued prisoners there.
Edward Evans also, an honest and substantial man,
was committed to prison for the same supposed offence,
who was convinced some time before;
I having had some weighty discourse with him about the things of God.
He told me that while he was in prison with Vavasor Powell
(and many more of their brethren in Pool jail),
Vavasor, leaning upon a prison window that faced the street,
saw me and my dear wife pass by, and said, "`Behold Zacharias and Elizabeth.
It was said of them that they walked in all the commandments of God blamelessly.`"
This Edward Evans, and some others of the prisoners, looking out through the window,
saw us two called Quakers,
whom he and others had preached severely against a little time before.
They believed that the Lord had forced Vavasor to give that testimony of us,
and several of them, as Edward Evans said,
were convinced by that testimony of his concerning us;
and some time after came to live in obedience to the truth, and suffered for it.

These prisoners were kept very confined. Some of them were substantial landowners,
who were put in a low room, a dirty, nasty place;
and the felons and other malefactors were put in a chamber overhead,
so that their excrement often fell upon those in the room below.
Charles Lloyd, who was in commission of the peace a little time before,
was put in a little smoky room,
and laid upon a little straw for a considerable time;
and at length his tender wife Elizabeth (who was of a considerable family,
daughter of Sampson Lort, near Pembroke in South Wales)
was made willing to lie upon straw with her dear and tender husband.
And thus they both, with the other Friends,
"`chose rather to suffer affliction with the people of God,
than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season.`"

I stayed with them for some time, keeping our meetings in prison;
but at length the jailer had strict charge to keep me from them, alleging
that I strengthened them in their way and principles. And when the jailer kept me out,
I went to a neighbour`'s backyard, having his permission to see them and speak with them there.

The sufferings of Friends being now very great, and still increasing,
they sent the following paper to the quarter-sessions held at Montgomery.

[.embedded-content-document.paper]
--

[.letter-heading]
To the Justices and Magistrates of this County of Montgomery.

Seeing it is not unknown to you, that we (who by the scorners of this world
who know not God are called Quakers) are detained and kept close prisoners
for nothing more than the testimony of a good conscience towards God and man,
nevertheless, our friends are not permitted to visit us; though drunkards, liars,
thieves and robbers, are not denied admittance to us by their friends.
This unheard of cruelty,
instead of convincing us of our supposed errors (as you allege),
is far more likely to establish us in our opinions.
We are persuaded in our hearts that neither Christ, nor any of his apostles, ever
used this or any other way of cruelty or persecution, to convince any of their errors,
but on the contrary, by sound doctrine, and good conduct, and "`doing unto others
what they want others to do unto them;`" for that was
the rule that Christ left to true Christians.

Now consider this, in the soberness of your hearts and spirits:
if you were in our condition, would you not desire your freedom?
And seeing it is the king`'s clemency,
in a declaration bearing the date the 26th day of December, 1662, wherein he says
he is "`glad to take advantage of this occasion
to reestablish and renew unto all his subjects concerned in those promises,
the indulgence of a true tenderness of conscience.`"
This assurance and confirmation of his promise made at Breda,
"`upon the word of a king,`" is as follows:

"`We do declare all liberty to tender consciences, and that no man shall be disquieted,
or called in question for differences of opinions in matters of religion.`"
And moreover he says in the same declaration, that he desires liberty
"`to those who, living peaceably, do not conform thereunto
through scruple and tenderness of misguided consciences,
but who modestly, and without scandal, perform their devotions in their own way.`"

We understand by these words that it is his fatherly care
to publish this declaration, to stop and prevent all other acting
according to former acts made against liberty of tender consciences.
And we hope that you will be as favourable to us, your neighbours
(seeing power is committed to your hands), as the king, being chief magistrate,
is unto his subjects.
These things we have seen fit and convenient to lay before you,
that you may understand we are not ignorant of the king`'s clemency towards us.
And we, whose names are underwritten,
await the fulfilling and performing of these words of the king,
by you who profess yourselves to be his obedient and loyal subjects.
Notwithstanding all these words and promises of the king (the supreme magistrate),
we have been persecuted more by you (his inferior magistrates) in this county,
than in many other counties.
And furthermore, we desire to make these things known to you so
you may be left without excuse that, if you do persecute us,
it is without any cause from us, or any order from the supreme magistrate,
the king of England.
If you do justice herein, the Lord will bless you; if not, sin will lie at your door.

This is from your friends, who desire the good
and welfare of your souls and bodies, and who have
received the spirit of meekness; who can pray for them that persecute us
and despitefully use us, and
who in patience and longsuffering are content to submit to the will of God,
who renders to every man according to the deeds done in the flesh.

The foregoing paper was sent to the magistrates at their quarter-sessions,
held at Montgomery, the 8th day of the eleventh month, 1662.

A copy of it was also sent to the chief justices at Ludlow by the jailer,
along with another paper directed to them.

A little time after this I went to Penllyn, near Bala, in Merionethshire,
to visit some Friends and tender professors there, who received me kindly.
I established a meeting there among them, in the power of God,
and from there returned home, where I stayed but a little while, to visit these prisoners.
Soon after I went to the house of Owen Lewis, at Tyddyney Gareg, near Dolgelle,
in Merionethshire, a man that had been in commission of the peace in Oliver`'s days,
and had recently come from prison from Bala. This man received me kindly;
he was first convinced by Thomas Briggs.
From there I went to Robert Owen`'s of Dolycere, near Dolgelle,
who had also been a justice of peace, and a commander in Oliver`'s time.
He received me and my testimony, as did Owen Humphrey
(who was a justice of the peace in Oliver`'s days) of Llwyngwril,
near the seaside in the said county,
along with his father and his brothers, Samuel and John Humphrey.
These, with many more there, received the truth in the love of it,
and continued faithful, serviceable men in their country.
They kept meetings in their houses, and many were gathered to
the Lord among the rocks and mountains in those parts;
this was in the year 1662.
After this journey, the Lord brought me safely home to my wife and family,
to the comfort of Friends, and to one another in the Lord.

Not long after this, Thomas Lloyd (brother to Charles Lloyd, of Dolobran),
hearing his brother was in prison, came from Oxford to visit him,
having been a student there several years,
as his brother Charles had been before him.
They told me that the great sufferings of Friends in that city of Oxford
by the magistrates and the wild and ungodly scholars had much affected them,
and they had a secret love for Friends at that time.
So when Thomas Lloyd came home, having been for some time with Friends
in prison and elsewhere, the Lord opened his understanding by His light, life, and power,
and he received the truth and was obedient to it, took up his daily cross,
and followed Jesus. He came to be His disciple, and was taught by Him,
and went no more to Oxford for learning; and I may say with David,
"`The Lord made him wiser than all his former teachers.`"
He stayed pretty much at home, in these parts,
and with his eldest brother Charles Lloyd.

The jailer of Welch-Pool was very cruel to Friends,
and continued to keep them in that nasty hole before-mentioned, till Edward Evans fell sick,
by reason of the dampness and unhealthiness of the room, and died.
The jailer would not permit us to have his body to be buried
unless we payed the coroner, and so clear him, as if he had no hand in his death.
But at last his relations prevailed without a coroner`'s inquest,
and they took Evans`' body and buried him on a hill,
on the back-side of the steeple-house in Welch-Pool. And it happened,
as they were digging the grave, that they found some bones of a man,
and upon inquiry in some old records,
it was found that there was an old judge buried there;
and the name of that place has been called
Judge`'s Hill ever since.
We had no burying place of our own at this time, but were looking to obtian one.

Thomas Lloyd and I were not prisoners at this time, although besides us two,
most that were then convinced were prisoners.
The report of those who turned Quakers being spread abroad,
these were soon summoned before a magistrate,
and the oath of allegiance and supremacy was tendered both to men and women;
and they, upon refusing to take it for for conscience-sake,
were sent to prison in order to be premunired.^
footnote:[Premunire was a legal judgment designed to disenfranchise those
who refused to formally swear allegiance to the King.
Those under a sentence of premunire were considered traitors to their country.
They lost all rights to property and possessions,
were removed from under the king`'s protection, and were often imprisoned for life.]

My friend Thomas Lloyd and I were moved to go and visit most of the
justices that had a hand in committing Friends to prison.
We began at the justice nearest to Machynlleth, and traveled south to Edward,
Lord Herbert, Baron of Cherbury, at Llyssin beforementioned,
who had committed Charles Lloyd to prison, along with several other Friends.
On our way to visit him we were informed that he and several others were then at a bowling-green,
near a place called the Cann Office, near the highway side
and not far from Llyssin, where we came and beheld them bowling.
We considered amongst ourselves what we should do, there being a peevish priest
(the said lord`'s chaplain) with them; and I asked Thomas Lloyd
whether he would engage the priest in discourse or go to the lord.
Choosing the latter, he began to walk leisurely towards him.
Most then present knew Thomas, but he did not approach them in
their customary complimenting posture.
He stayed there but a little while, and they broke up their game,
and while he discoursed with the Lord Herbert, I discoursed a little with the priest.
Lord Herbett coming towards the priest and me, he said to the priest, "`Mr. Jones,
what have you got there?`"
He answered, "`A Quaker, a hat-maker, who lives in Welch-Pool.`"
"`Oh!`" said Lord Herbert, "`I thought he was such a one,
he keeps his hat quite fastened to his head.`"
Then, he intending and preparing to come down a great steep ditch,
I stepped down to lend him my hand to help him;
another priest would have stepped between me and him,
but Lord Herbert refused the priest`'s help, and stopping a little, said to the priest,
"`If I take your hand, this brother standing by will have cause to say,
'`The blind leads the blind, and both will fall into the ditch.`'`"
The priest was so drunk, that he could not stand by himself.
This lord being a very big fat man, he accepted my help to come down,
and so we went along with him towards his own house at Llyssin,
laying the sufferings of our Friends before him,
and making known to him that their sufferings were for their conscience sakes towards God.
He gave us no grant for their freedom at this time,
but we heard that he sent private instructions, and they were given more liberty.
The jailer had an empty house at the end of the town, and there he let Friends go,
which was a sweet, convenient place near the fields, without any keeper over them,
and they had the liberty of the town to go where they pleased,
except to their own houses.

So Charles Lloyd took a house in town for him and his family to live in,
and we kept our meetings in that house of the jailer`'s aforesaid for several years.
Most of the Friends being under a premunire by this time,
many Friends came from several places to visit them,
and those that were convinced near Machynlleth (William Evans
and several others of that end of the county), who were formerly Independents,
were sent here to prison upon the same account--
for refusing to take the oath of allegiance and supremacy.
Peter Price also, a worthy man of Radnorshire, was sent to this prison,
who had been in commission of the peace in Oliver`'s days. He,
with several others, were committed by the justices of this county
to the house of correction in Welch-Pool, for three months, as vagrants,
because they came out of their own county of Radnorshire,
adjoining to this county of Montgomeryshire. Here they remained the three months sentenced,
but they had the liberty of the town,
and to go to the meetings with the rest of the prisoners.
Other Friends, that lived in and about the town, met with them in prison,
and we had considerable meetings in that house.

A little after this, Thomas Ellis, called a deacon in the Independent congregation,
was convinced. He was a man of great esteem among them,
and so he was also afterwards among us.
He came to my house to visit the prisoners, his former fellow church members,
and showed me a letter that came to him from their minister, Vavasor Powell,
lamenting the deplorable condition and danger they were in at that time; saying,
that the Christians were in great danger of being split between two rocks,
the World and the Quakers, "`but the worst,`"
said he, "`is the Quakers.`" But the Lord had opened Thomas Ellis`'s understanding,
and given him a sight of their deadness and formalities.
Some years before, the Lord had broken in among them,
to the convincing of many of them; for Thomas told me that two women Friends came there among them
(I suppose it was before I came from London),
in the time of their breaking of the bread. And
when these women were moved by the spirit of truth,
they opened their mouths in the name of the Lord, in much fear and humility,
so that the Independent elders stood still and gave the
women permission to speak what they had to say to the people.
When they had finished, the professors went on again with their business,
and after some time the Friends spoke again.
This time the professors commanded them to be taken away,
but no one was very willing to do it.
Then their minister, Vavasor Powell, called, "`Brother Ellis, take them away.`"
Thomas Ellis told me
that he had remembered Christ was not hasty in passing sentence upon the woman
that the Jews brought before Him in the case of adultery, but He had stooped down,
and wrote with His finger upon the ground, as though He had not heard them.
So Thomas Ellis told me he was not willing to take these two women away,
till they had fully cleared themselves of what they had to deliver among them.
But at last they called to him again, and bid him take them away.
Then he rose from among the company and went to them,
and desired them to go with him to the next room, telling them he had something to say to them,
and the Friends went readily with him. Then he spoke to them in this way: "`Friends,
you see how we are met together here; we are like the Prodigal,
who was spending his portion, and we have a little yet unspent;
and when we have spent all, we must return to our heavenly Father,
and come to you and your way.`" The Friends went away well satisfied.
I have made much inquiry who these Friends were, and from where they came,
but could not learn for certain who they were.
As for our Friend Thomas Ellis, the Lord blessed him, and poured His Spirit upon him,
and gave him a share in the ministry,
and he became a faithful labourer and serviceable man among us;
and at length he was made a prisoner here at Welch-Pool.

About the year 1663, our Friend James Parkes came from the north,
hearing that some of his former acquaintances and fellow church-members
had come to acknowledge the truth.
He came to give them a visit in the love of God,
and also to visit those Independents he formerly walked among that were not convinced;
and he left a paper with me to deliver to them, which was thus:

[.embedded-content-document.paper]

[.old-style]
=== A Lamentation and Warning from the Lord God and in the Love of Christ Jesus / Unto all the professors in North Wales, especially those in and near Wrexham in Denbighshire, and Welch-Pool in Montgomeryshire, whom I have known formerly, and walked with in a form of fellowship and worship, till the Lord awakened me out of sleep, and opened an ear in me to hear His voice, which cried, "`Come out from among them, and be separate; touch no unclean thing, and I will receive you.`"

[.salutation]
Friends,

Hear and lend an ear, you professors of Wrexham and Welch-Pool,
and all the ajacent places and towns, who have been called churches of Christ,
and members of His body, and followers of the Lamb.
I have come in my Father`'s name to visit you, and in the compassion of His love
I have visited many of you, in this the day of your calamity and adversity,
and in obedience to His command. He sent me in His name and fear into these parts at this time
chiefly for your sakes, that you might hear and come to fear Him,
whose voice has shaken the earth, and removed it out of its place.
He is causing the keepers of the house to tremble,
and in many He has bound the strong man who was armed, and formerly kept the house;
then all was at peace, but a stronger than he has risen,
and is manifested in the hearts of thousands. This Man is Christ Jesus, the light of the world,
who enlightens everyone that comes into the world, that all in Him and through Him
might believe.
He is dividing the spoil, and spoiling principalities and powers;
and they whose eyes come to see Him, the Lord of Hosts, come to be undone.
When Moses saw the appearance of the Lord, he feared and trembled exceedingly.
It was He that made Habakkuk tremble, and his lips to quiver.
And whoever comes to know Christ, must know Him through death,
be baptized into His death, and suffer with Him,
before they come to live and reign with Him.
They must repent of all their wickedness, and turn from it,
before they can come to be assured of rest and peace.
Let none think God will wink at their wickedness, as He did in the times of ignorance;
for now He is leaving all without excuse, and calling every man to repent.
The light is risen
that manifests sin and hypocrisy in them that hold the truth in unrighteousness;
it is not being called "`church-members`" that will be of any benefit to you.

O you professors of all sorts, from the highest to the lowest,
from the richest to the poorest!
I am moved of the Lord God to warn you, that while you have time and space,
you may be redeemed out of all evil, and come out from among evil-doers,
and so be saved from the wrath and destruction
that will overtake the workers of iniquity,
who do not repent of their evil deeds, nor give God the glory.
These, with the whirlwind of His wrath, He will vex in His sore displeasure.
O you professors of Christ and of the apostles`' words! You who are not come to His life,
nor of the same mind that He was of, who endured the contradiction of sinners,
and was made perfect through sufferings. It was He who the apostles bore testimony to
and suffered for; being of the same mind, they did not shrink nor bow,
nor let go of their testimony when persecution arose because of the word;
but they overcame by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of His testimony
which they held; and they loved not their lives unto death.
Are you all so blind,
that you cannot see yourselves to be outside of the light and image of Christ,
and out of their practice who followed Him, and confessed Him,
and did not deny Him before men, nor change their religion
in accordnace to the changing of earthly authorities?
For whatever the authorities of the earth approved or disapproved
was of no importance to those who were of the true church that is in God,
the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the pillar and ground of truth.
But that which God manifested to be His will, this they did;
and though they were charged by the authorities of the time to speak no more in His name,
yet they spoke in His name, and did not deny it.

Do you dare to say that you are saints, and of this church of Christ,
and yet live in the breach of His commandments, who said,
'`Swear not at all;`' as some more eminent in esteem among you have done,
and have taught others to do?
Does not the land mourn because of swearing?
Are those who do so not like the scribes and pharisees,
who would not enter into the kingdom of heaven themselves,
nor allow them that were willing to enter in?
Are these not now shutting up the kingdom of heaven against men?
And must not the woes of the Lord be pronounced against them?
Yes, assuredly, and they shall be overtaken by them; pain shall suddenly come upon them,
as on a travailing woman, and they shall not escape it.
The Lord has come to deliver His people out of the teeth of these devourers,
who with good words and fair speeches have deceived the
hearts of some more simple and honest among you,
and made merchandize of them, by promising them peace
while they are yet in their wicked ways and works. This the true prophets and apostles of old,
whom the Lord sent, could not do; neither can they who are of
the same royal seed or lineage now; they know there is no peace to be spoken to any
while they are in their wicked ways, drinking up iniquity as the ox drinks water.
Oh, my heart is broken within me, and I cannot but lament for you, to see you,
who have been esteemed beautiful, and the glory of many so-called churches,
carried away captive by the prince of the power of the air
that rules in the children of disobedience;
and that you are yet lying under the bondage of corruption and in sin,
the wages of which is death, outside of the glorious liberty of the sons of God;
and death is yet reigning over you, subjecting you to the power of the enemy.
You are taken captive by him at his will, laden with sins,
and led away with various lusts,
like the silly women spoken of in the scriptures, that were ever learning
and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth, but instead resisted it;
and so you err in your minds, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God,
though you talk of them.
If you knew the scriptures and the power of God which brings us into the life of them,
you would witness the ability the saints had in former times
(and which the saints of the Most High still have today) to stand over the powers of darkness,
hell and death; then you would come to that which cannot be shaken,
and that which the gates of hell cannot prevail against.
But have not the powers of darkness prevailed against you, overcome you,
and made you bow to their will and to their laws, which bind the conscience,
and hinder its full liberty?

Oh consider seriously, and weigh in the stillness of your spirits,
and in the fear of the Lord, what you have done!
Consider whether you have not received the beast`'s mark,
either on your foreheads or on your hands. Have you not fainted in the day of adversity?
Have you not let go the profession of your faith, and wavered in your minds?
Have you not licked up your old vomit again?
Are you not wallowing in the filth of iniquity, and in your fleshly minds,
walking in sensuality and in the carnal mind, which is enmity against God?
Is it not death to be carnally minded?
Are they not in death that are in the carnal mind?
It is not strange to me to find such enmity working in you,
because I expect no other from natural men who do not perceive the things of the Spirit.
You have rejected the chief corner-stone, which is laid in Zion for a foundation,
and have not believed in the Light of the world,
who has become the Headstone in God`'s building and husbandry,
and of the church that is pure, without spot or wrinkle, which is in God, the Father
of our Lord Jesus Christ, the pillar and ground of Truth.
This is the city sought out, and not forsaken.
This is the habitation of God through the Spirit,
the stones of which are laid with fair colours, the foundation with sapphire,
and all the borders with pleasant stones.
These being redeemed out of sin, and out from under the bondage of corruption,
cannot plead for it, as some who are revered among you do,
who would endeavour to make you believe
that the prophet Isaiah was always a man of unclean lips;
while this scripture refers to before he was "`undone,`" and while the "`woe`" was upon him.

Ah, brutish is that spirit which would imagine that our God would
make use of a man to do as much for His name
and honour as Isaiah did, and yet remain a man of unclean lips.
Such manifest themselves to be ignorant of Christ`'s death and manifestations,
which are to take away sin, for in Him is no sin.
This I testify, that before Isaiah was sent of the Lord,
his iniquity was taken away, and his sin purged out.
And all that come to believe in His light, and to walk in it,
have fellowship with one another,
and the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses them from all sin.
Such come by Him to be made free from sin, and servants of righteousness; not of sin,
for sin and iniquity come to be done away; and then God beholds no iniquity in Jacob,
nor transgression in Israel. To such is given the tongue of the learned,
to speak a word in due season to the weary.
Such come to know the pure language, which the Lord promised to restore to His people.
Such set a watch over their mouths, and have a bridle over their tongue.

Now some plead for uncleanness, because the prophet said he was a man of unclean lips,
before he was touched with the lively coal, and before his iniquity was done away
and his sins purged out.
Assuredly one day you shall all know that this plea is a false covering,
too narrow to cover yourselves with--you who break the commands of Christ
and teach others to do the same, and put your hands to the plough but look back,
so that you are not fit for the kingdom of heaven.
You are filled with your own ways, wicked devices,
and the false coverings you gather to cover yourselves with;
but all your false coverings will prove too narrow, and your beds of ease
and false rests, which you think to stretch yourselves upon, too short;
and you shall have no rest or peace there, but you shall all be yet further tried,
and your folly be made more manifest. And all the false coverings
that all the professors who are outside of the life and power of
God have sought to cover themselves with, shall be plucked off; yes,
all who are covered with coverings other than the Spirit of the Lord.
Woe to them who are adding sin to sin, and have not come to cleanness of heart,
or cleanness of lips; and as long as you remain in your uncleanness,
and continue to plead for it, then you should blush for shame!
Relinquish the title of church-membership, till you come to tread in the steps of Christ
and obey Him; for you are that one`'s slaves whom you obey.
Deceive yourselves no longer by bearing the name of Christians only, but come to its nature,
to witness the first old nature and birth slain and brought under.
This you all must do, before you ever come to know the new nature or birth
that is of the Spirit; for that which is born of the flesh is flesh,
and that which is born of the Spirit is Spirit.
If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature; old things are passed away,
and all things are become new.
The church of Christ is made up of living stones, squared and hewn into order,
complete together, and made into a spiritual household, purged, washed, and made white,
the filth of the flesh being done away.
Such come to be vessels of honour, fit for the Master`'s use;
these receive into their earthen vessel of the heavenly treasure,
and out of the abundance of the treasury of the heart bring forth good things.
"`With the heart man believes unto righteousness;
and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.`"

So everyone come to Him that searches the heart, tries the reins,
and will reward everyone according to their works or deeds done in the body,
whether they be good or evil; for the Lord God will no longer be mocked;
such as you sow you must reap. He will no longer bear your offering of the lame and blind,
and your dead worship, which is outside of the life and power of God.
Your hypocrisy and dissimulation is seen by the spirit of Truth
that leads and guides into all Truth,
which you shall one day know is now striving with you,
as it did with those before the flood; yet this Spirit shall not always strive with men.
It says, `"who requires these things at your hands?`"

And do you now think that God is pleased or served with the dry, dead,
and airy services and forms of worship?
I tell you, no. The light of the glorious gospel is manifest,
and the pearl of great price is found, and many have sold
and parted with all that was most dear to them, and that which they most delighted in,
to buy it; and they who come to believe in Christ Jesus (who is the Light, the Way, the Truth,
and the Life), and walk in the light, do not stumble, nor stagger at the promises;
but come to have life in themselves, and their minds, words, and actions, are seasoned.
They are the salt of the earth, a city set on a hill, that cannot be hid;
and their lights so shine before men, that they who are not willfully blind
may see their good works and "`godly conduct coupled with fear;`"
and they that walk in the light, as He is in the light, have fellowship with one another,
and they witness the blood of Christ cleansing them from all sin.
So if ever you come to know God aright,
you must turn to the light that reproves you for evil,
for the reproof of instruction is the way to life;
and they that hate that which reproves them for their evil deeds
and sets their sins in order before them, abide in the chambers of death,
and do not feel rest, life, and peace in their souls.
Now as you come to the light and wait in the light which comes from Christ,
all your sins will be set in order before you,
and it will show you all that ever you did (as you inevitably shall be shown one day,
to your woe and misery, if you continue rejecting Him).
This is He in whom we believe, and of whom the prophets and apostles bore witness,
whose name is better than every name, unto which every knee must bow,
and every tongue confess; and every tongue that would rise up in judgment against Him
shall be condemned, and shall fall before Him.

Therefore beware, and be careful what you do; repent of all your evil deeds,
of all your hard speeches which you have uttered against Him
and His glorious appearance in His sons and daughters in the day of His power,
wherein He has made many willing to follow Him wherever He goes,
even through many tribulations; these have washed their robes in the blood of the Lamb;
while you deny Him,
and will follow Him no further than will make for your peace in the world
and the enjoyment of your pleasures, and thus keep the friendship and favour of the world,
which none ever did but those who had adulterated from the life of God,
and turned against the pure spirit of God in themselves; and this you shall one day know.

So whether you will hear or forbear, in this I shall have peace.
My reward is with God, in that I have discharged my duty
and warned you before your day is wholly over,
and before the Lord ceases stretching forth His hand.
It is He who knows and searches the hearts of all men, and knows my love
towards you all, and towards that light in your consciences which comes
from Him, and is pure, and has never consented to sin. It is by this light,
and by nothing else, that I can and desire to be made manifest to you.
I believe there is a seed to be brought forth among you,
which must be gathered into the true fold of everlasting rest and peace.
For this seed`'s sake I (who am your friend,
and seek not what is yours, but you)
travail night and day, waiting for its redemption and restoration,
that you might come to know in your day, before they are hidden from your eyes,
the things that concern your everlasting peace, comfort, and true settlement,
upon that rock that cannot be shaken, nor the gates of hell ever prevail against.
Knowing the terrors of the Lord
and the wrath that will be revealed from heaven
against all that hold the Truth in unrighteousness,
and having obtained mercy from the Lord, and in His name, the strong tower, hid myself,
I cannot but persuade all to come into the same,
being in a deep sense of the lovingkindness of the Lord,
and what He has done for my soul since I walked with you
and was esteemed one of you, all of which I cannot here relate.
Indeed, I am unable to demonstrate the lovingkindness of the Lord
in the visitation of His pure love, in turning me from darkness
(which I must confess I walked in all the time I was with you) into His marvellous light,
and from the power of Satan unto God.
He has made me to feel and witness His power, wherein, through His good will towards me,
I have found the ability to perform and to do the good
that I desired to do while among you;
and likewise to resist the evil that I desired not to do.
This is the Lord`'s own doing, and it is marvellous in my eyes,
and I desire to never forget the Lord`'s great love to me,
and powerful effectual working in me, to "`will and to do of His own good pleasure.`"
I do not desire to eat my morsel alone,
but desire that all may come to taste and see how good the Lord is.
Great and marvellous are His works, just and true are all His ways;
He waits to be gracious, and there is no want to them that fear the Lord.
He never forsakes, nor withholds any good thing from them that walk uprightly.

So, Friends, while you have time, prize it, and do not put the day of the Lord far from you,
for the Lord is not slack concerning His promise, as some men count slackness,
but His longsuffering is to the end that none should perish,
but that all shall come to repentance.
Now is the day that every man`'s works must be tried,
and every man`'s faith and love to God will be tried.
Now is the day that many great professors make shipwreck of their faith
and of a good conscience,
and some that formerly seemed somewhat tender and honest among you,
have grown dull and brutish, and their understandings darkened,
through the ignorance that is in them.
The god of this world has blinded the eyes of many great professors,
by keeping them from the light that would show them their ways
and the works which they are doing out of the light,
in the blindness which has come over them. But if you would come to the light of God in you,
which is pure, then you would receive power to perform the acceptable
will and requirings of the Lord.

That you might come to know and do these things is the desire of your friend,
who seeks not yours but you, and desires your everlasting peace and happiness,
formerly known to and esteemed by you as a brother, by the name of

Wrexham, the 9th of the first month, 1662.

--

Several Friends, both from the North and South of England,
were drawn to visit these Friends in prison,
and many sweet and comfortable epistles were written to them.

There was a great convincement in the year 1662 in the counties of Montgomeryshire
and Merionethshire; and as meetings increased, several Friends came into Welch-Pool,
where our meeting was kept in the house that was their prison.
The magistrates and priest were discontented, some saying
that as many people came to our meeting as went to their worship at the church
(as they called it).
So the magistrates resolved to come and break up our meeting,
and one first-day Thomas Corbet (a counsellor and a justice of the peace in this county),
along with the two bailiffs of the town, the Sergeants
at mace, and the under officers, came into our meeting.
When they entered the meeting I was in prayer,
and they were indifferently civil till I had concluded, when they began to write down our names.
When they had finished, my wife called to justice Corbet, and told him
that they had not taken the names of all that were at the meeting. He asked her
who'`s name wasn'`t taken, and she
held out her child towards him, about a quarter of a year old.
He said that he was under age.
She answered, "`We are all as innocent from plotting, contriving,
or thinking any harm to any man as this little child,`"
which much smote this Thomas Corbet, and several others present.
They committed me to one sergeant`'s house, and Thomas Lloyd,
brother to Charles Lloyd and Samuel Lloyd (son to Samuel Lloyd of Dudson,
in the county of Salop, eldest brother to John and David Lloyd of London,
and Edward Lloyd of Bristol), to the other sergeant`'s house.
When the sergeant whose house I was committed to returned from the steeple-house,
he turned me out, and bid me go home, saying I should not stay at his house.
So first I went to see my friends the old prisoners,
who we had not been permitted to see for some time,
they having been confined more closely. They were very glad to see me,
and I also was refreshed to see them, though we could not visit with one another.
In a little time I went to see the other two prisoners
who were at the other sergeant`'s house,
and the sergeant let them come home with me.

On the second-day following it entered my mind
that the magistrates would try us with an offer
to overlook our transgression (as they called it),
on the condition that we would go to the steeple-house to
attend their worship the next first-day following;
which I told to Friends.

On the third-day following, justice Corbet
and the two bailiffs that had committed us to prison sent for us to come before them.
So we went--Thomas Lloyd, Samuel Lloyd, and myself.
After some discourse with them, they proposed to us
that if we would go to church and hear divine service, as they called it,
we would be discharged.
I told them that when I was last there, they had turned me out of their church,
and if I should make any promise to go there,
it may be that they would do the same to me again.
Justice Corbet said he would ensure that I would not be turned out.
Then I told them that, unless otherwise directed by the Lord,
I felt nothing against my going there.
Justice Corbet seemed to be satisfied; but one of the bailiffs said, "`Mr. Corbet,
do you think that the old Quaker would agree to come to church
for any reason other than to disturb our minister?`"
Corbet asked me again whether I would disturb the minister.
I told him that if God should put something on my heart to speak to the people,
I hoped they would not impose me to hold my peace.
He said, "`God forbid that we would do so!`"
Then I told him I hoped to perform what I had promised to do;
and so they discharged us.
Now none was under an engagement to go to the steeple-house but myself,
and the report went about that "`the old Quaker`" would be attending church.

When first-day came, and the bells began to ring, the other two Friends,
Thomas Lloyd and Samuel Lloyd, came to me and said,
"`We think we must go with you to the steeple-house.`"
When the people began to make their way to the steeple-house, I took my bible under my arm,
and went to justice Corbet`'s house
(which was but a few doors from my house) to let him see that I was going, and to ask him
whether he was coming.
He said he was not disposed to come that day,
but he would send his man to see that we should not be affronted.
So the two Friends and I went to my own pew, which was opposite to the pulpit.
Only the curate was present to read the common prayer
and their service to them that morning. There was a great multitude of people; some said
there were some present that had not been to their church for several years.
Nothing was laid upon us to speak to the people till the curate had finished;
then I stood up, and said to the people,
"`I suppose you are not ignorant of the cause of our coming here this day, which is as follows:
the magistrates of the town came to our meeting,
and they found us upon our knees praying to Almighty God.
They were civil while we were at prayer, and when we had finished,
they took our names and committed us three to prison,
most of the others at the meeting being prisoners already.
And the magistrates told us that if we would come to church, we would be discharged;
and now you see we have come according to their desire.
But I find that your priest is not here, and now I wish you to inform him
that I say:

[.numbered-group]
====

[.numbered]
1+++.+++ If he prove this to be the true church of Christ;

[.numbered]
2+++.+++ And that he is a true minister of Christ;

[.numbered]
3+++.+++ And that his maintenance is a gospel maintenance;

[.numbered]
4+++.+++ And this worship of yours to be the true worship of God;

====

[.offset]
Then we will be of your religion, and come to you again.
But if he doesn`'t prove this, then we must conclude:

[.numbered-group]
====

[.numbered]
1+++.+++ Your church to be a false church;

[.numbered]
2+++.+++ And he to be no true minister of Christ;

[.numbered]
3+++.+++ That his maintenance is no gospel maintenance;

[.numbered]
4+++.+++ That your worship is not the true worship of God.

====

All the people were very civil and orderly,
and listened to me for a considerable time in the steeple-house.
When I had finished, Thomas Lloyd spoke a few very seasonable words to the people.
And the people said,
"`If Mr. Langford (which was the priest`'s name) will not
prove us to be the true church of Christ,
and our worship to be the true worship, then we will not pay him any more tithes;
for what Richard Davies said he proved out of the bible; for you see,
he had the bible in his hand all the while.`"
So for that time we parted.

When the bells rang again for them to go to their evening service,
it lay upon my heart to go there again, and the aforesaid Friends went along with me.
This time the old high priest was present, who made a long sermon till we were all uneasy;
but I desired the Friends to bear all things patiently.
When the priest had finished, and was going away, I stepped up in my seat
and desired him to stay, for I had something to say to him.
When he heard my queries aforementioned, and what I had to say,
he turned his back and went away, and gave us no answer.
Then I said, "`Behold the hireling flees because he is a hireling.`"
Some of the people stayed, and some went with him, but all were dissatisfied
that he would not prove them to be the true church of Christ, etc.
I had a good opportunity to speak to the people more openly in the graveyard,
and the Lord`'s presence, life and power was with us;
blessed be the name of the Lord forever,
who does not forsake His people that trust in Him.

When we came home, justice Corbet sent for us again.
He met us in his court, and said he was sorry that Mr. Langford was so uncivil
as not to answer our queries, which he thought were very reasonable.
In a little time, many of the neighbours were gathered together in the street
and in his court, and we had a good opportunity to reason with him,
and to reveal to the people and declare to them the way and means to obtain the kingdom of heaven.
Justice Corbet was so moderate, that one of the neighbours said to him, "`Mr. Corbet,
we think you will be a Quaker too.`"
His answer was, "`I wish I were a Quaker in my life and conduct.`"
Towards the end of our discourse, he desired me to give him my queries in writing,
so that Mr. Langford might answer them; "`for,`" said he,
"`it may be he was not prepared to answer you then, but he may answer them in writing.`"
I told him that that was but a private way of answering;
but if the priest had not been prepared that evening,
we would give him an opportunity to answer us next first-day at the steeple-house,
or in the town-hall upon a market day.
The justice said that was very fair.

Counsellor Corbet was very friendly and loving to us,
and persecuted us no longer to his dying day,
but did us all the good he could in all the courts of judicature where he was concerned.

As for this priest, William Langford,
many Friends were moved to go to him at the steeple-house in the time of his service,
to declare to him and the people what they had to say from the Lord;
and when the magistrates committed some of them to prison on that account,
when their service was over, this priest was the one who procured their liberty.

Some time after this, he sent the clerk of the parish to me for Easter-reckonings.
I asked the clerk if his master expected anything from me,
who had obtained nothing from him, and bid him tell his master that
I would come to reckon with him by and by.
So the clerk went his way,
and in a little time I made myself ready.
When I went to him, there were many people with him.
I told him that he had sent his clerk to me
for that which he called Easter-reckonings, and I had come to reckon with him.
If he could prove that I owed him anything, I would pay him,
and I expected the same from him.
He said I owed him for several years`' sacrament.
I asked him what he meant by the word sacrament,
for I found no such word in the scripture. He said
it meant the bread and wine which was used in the church.
I told him I received none from him, and was therefore not liable to pay.
He answered, "`Why, then you may come to church and receive it.`"
I told him I did not believe that church was the true church of Christ,
and I did not believe that he was a true minister of Christ,
commissioned by Him to break the bread and give it to the people, much less to sell it,
or take money for it from the people; for I read nowhere in all the scripture
that the true ministers of Christ took money from the
people for the bread they delivered unto them.
He then said that the labourer was worthy of his hire; and under the law it was said,
"`You shall not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treads out the corn.`"
I told him he trod out no corn for me; and though he was a hireling,
yet I never hired him.

The people coming in large numbers to pay him for the bread and wine, I asked him
how his conscience allowed him to take so much money for so little bread and wine, it being,
I suppose, about ten pence for a man and his wife.
I asked him what scripture he had to justify his actions,
and desired him to prove his practice by scripture.
He asked me what scripture I had to justify my eating pudding.
I told him there was scripture to justify my eating it.
Paul said to Timothy, "`For every creature of God is good, and nothing is to be refused
if it is received with thanksgiving;
for it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer,`" 1 Tim. 4:4-5.
His communicants who were present
were very dissatisfied that he had no better answer or proof for his practice.
I desired the people to take notice that he could not prove by scripture
that I owed anything; but I told them he owed me some money,
and I desired him to pay it, which he did. So we parted fairly.
We have a saying that short accounts make long friends.
He was very friendly afterwards, and never again asked me for Easter-reckonings.
And as for the tithe, in the time of harvest,
he charged his servants to take from me
only what was due to them, or less.
I was told he would say he didn`'t know why he should take anything from me,
seeing I received nothing from him.
He lived here among us many years, and was a good neighbour;
and though this was during a time of great persecution,
he had no part in persecuting any of us.

We have cause to bless the Lord, who carried us through all our services and exercises
in the time of our weaknesses; and though we were little and low in our own eyes,
the Lord did not leave us. Blessed be His holy name forever.

About the year 1663 or 1664 I went to London,
and found some there who had separated from that love and unity in which I had formerly seen them,
they having joined in spirit with John Perrot,
who had recently come from prison at Rome to London,
with an appearance, as it was said, of humility and lowliness of mind.
A considerable company joined together with him,
and I too was among them for a little time.
The tendency of the spirit of this company was to speak evil of
those Friends who bore the greatest burden in the heat of the day,
and to cry out against these Friends as being dead and formal.
They expected a more glorious dispensation than had yet been known among Friends,
and they kept their hats on in time of prayer.
I was among them but a little while, till a veil of darkness came over me,
and under that veil,
I came to have a light esteem for my dear and ancient friend George Fox, and some others,
who in the past had been near and dear to me.
But it pleased the Lord to rend that veil of darkness,
and cause the light of His countenance to shine upon me once more,
whereby I came to see the doleful place I was led into,
by a spirit that tended to nothing else but self-exaltation,
and (under a pretence of humility and self-denial) the breach of that unity, love,
and fellowship that we formerly had together,
and the good esteem we had for one another in the Lord.
We are children of one Father, and thus should esteem one another above ourselves in the Lord.
There was no jar or contention among us before this time, but all dwelt together in love and unity,
and in the fellowship of that blessed gospel of peace, life and salvation.

Upon my return home from London,
I was soon taken to the same prison as my friends in Welch-Pool;
and shortly before I was sent there among them, the under-jailer dreamed
that in his fold he had a flock of sheep,
and that he was wrestling to get one ram into the fold with the sheep,
but could not get him in;
but when I came to prison, he said to my friend Charles Lloyd,
"`Now I have gotten the old ram in among the sheep.`"
But the jailer turned me out that night to my wife and family;
and though I was still a prisoner by name, and was premunired
as the rest of my friends and brethren were for several years,
I was not kept a close prisoner.

This was a time when most travelling Friends were taken into custody,
and though I was a prisoner, I felt it laid upon me to obtain liberty to go and visit Friends
in several counties in England and Wales;
so I followed my good Guide, who showed me what to do.
I went to the jailer, and told him I had a prospect to travel a little while,
and I could not go without acquainting him with it, because I was his prisoner.
He said, "`I expect you will go preach somewhere or another,
and then you will be taken to prison, and what shall I do then?`"
I told him that if I was taken prisoner, I would inform him where I was,
and he could send for me if he pleased; so he bid me to take care what I did.

In a little time, in the love of God, I took my leave here of my friends and family,
and committed myself to the protection of the Almighty.
I went to Shrewsbury, and from there to Worcestershire, where I had good service for the Lord.
From there I went to Tewkesbury, where I had never been before.
An ancient woman Friend followed my horse, and before I had put up at the inn,
she came up to me, and very cordially said she had a sense upon her heart
that I was one of her heavenly Father`'s children.
I went in and refreshed myself a little, and asked her
if she thought I might have a meeting with Friends that evening.
She readily said she would acquaint Friends with the prospect;
and after she had gone a little way out of the inn, she returned again,
and desired to know my name, that she might tell it to Friends.
I felt a stop in my mind concerning giving her my name,
though at that time I didn`'t know the cause;
and so I desired her to go in the name of the Lord, and if I came in the name of the Lord,
they would receive me.
So she went, and returned again, and told me I might have a meeting,
which was appointed to be at Susan Smithin`'s; and a blessed, heavenly meeting we had,
and the Lord indeed fulfilled our expectation.
There were a variety of professors at the meeting.
Some came to me the next morning,
and discoursed with me in a friendly manner about the things of God.

From there I went through Gloucestershire, where I had good meetings, and then to Bristol.
When I felt clear of Bristol, the Lord having blessed me
and preserved me thus far in my journey, I set forward towards Pembrokeshire.
I travelled with no companion but the Lord alone,
who was with me all along in my journey; He was my helper and preserver.
So I came to the house of our friend Lewis Davies, who gladly received me in the Lord.

I staying there some time, they lent me a horse to go to a meeting at Redstone,
and I left my own horse behind me,
thinking he might rest for some days after my hard riding.
When I arrived, I found the meeting was outdoors, there being no house
that I knew of able to contain the multitude of people.
When we came to the meeting, Meredith Edwards,
whom Friends judged unfit to preach the gospel,
had the boldness to speak to the people till they were weary of him,
and those who were sensible were burdened by him;
after some time a Friend stood up and silenced him.
The Lord was with us, His good presence was our comfort and satisfaction;
and after some time, I, who had sat as a stranger among them,
had an opportunity to open to the people
the things which belong to their eternal salvation.
After I concluded the meeting in prayer, the aforesaid man,
Meredith Edwards, stood up again and preached to the people.
As he was speaking, I turned my back upon him and walked away, and the Friends,
along with the majority of the people,
followed me.

As I was walking away, a Friend came and told me that there were two soldiers
(I understood afterwards they were the two sons of a
priest) who had taken my horse from Lewis Davies`' house and brought it here to the meeting.
Upon seeing my horse, I drew near to them, and asked them who had brought it here.
They asked me whether I was the man that came from Bristol, and I said I was.
"`Then,`" said they, "`you are the man we look for.`"
I asked them by what authority they came, or what warrant they had,
and they showed me their swords and pistols.
I told them that highway robbers used the same warrant.
Then I asked them how they dared venture to come here among such a large company; they said
they knew we were peaceable men, and would not resist;
otherwise they would have brought a greater force.
I told Friends we were not bound to obey them, and desired Friends to part
and leave only two or three with me; but Friends`' love was so great to me,
that most stayed together as a body around me.
So I asked a Friend to take my saddle and bridle
that was upon the Friend`'s horse I rode to the meeting on,
and put them upon my own horse. Then I got upon my horse,
and bid the priest`'s sons to take their hands off my horse,
for I did not fear their swords nor their pistols.
And I told them that if they had a warrant from any justice of the peace,
or lawful magistrate within the county, I would obey it.
Then they let my horse go, and I turned aside a little,
and saw them lay hold of the other man, Meredith Edwards (I could not call him a Friend,
because he was not guided by a right Spirit); and I turned my horse towards them again,
and told them that if any justice of the peace or lawful magistrate within the county
had anything to say to me, who came from Bristol,
he could find me at the house of William Bateman, in Haverfordwest, for
my business would require me to stay some time in the country.
So they let us go in a pretty friendly manner,
and I had several excellent meetings in Haverfordwest,
and other places in the county.

The last of these I had was at Pontchison, among the Welch.
Notice having been given of a Welchman coming to have a meeting in those parts,
many people attended, and I had good service for the Lord,
His truth being declared to them in their own language.
We had the meeting outdoors,
and I stood with my back towards the wall of Thomas Simmon`'s house.
I was young and strong, and my voice was heard from the steeple-house,
and most of those there came out to hear me,
so that very few came out with the priest when he had finished.
When the priest saw such a multitude, he fell into a passion,
and desired the constable to pull me down from where I was speaking.
It was reported that some told the priest they would not pull me down,
for I preached Christ and the gospel to them,
and they desired him to come and learn of me himself. I was informed
that the priest`'s wife and two of his daughters were at the meeting,
and were very loving and tender, and came to be convinced of the truth.
The Lord was not in any way deficient; His life, power, and good presence was with us,
and that meeting was the last I had in Pembrokeshire at that time.
The Friends of that county were very loving and caring
towards Friends that came from afar to visit them,
and they dwelt in love and unity among themselves.
My service felt weighty upon me, being without a companion; the Lord alone,
who knew the integrity of my heart, was my comfort, support, and exceedingly great reward.

As for Meredith Edwards, the two men before mentioned brought him before a justice.
The justice would have been moderate towards him, and would have showed him kindness, but he,
by his ungoverned temper, provoked the justice to anger,
so that he committed him to the house of correction as a vagrant for three months,
to the great trouble of Friends.
I was informed that the justices and magistrates of that county
were generally very moderate during the hardest times of persecution.

From Pontchison I took my leave of Friends in Pembrokeshire,
and came home pretty directly, to the comfort of my wife and family,
and those Friends that were prisoners; blessed be the name of the Lord.
The jailer was well satisfied that I returned to my prison
without troubling him further.
Several were taken prisoners at those meetings I was at,
but the Lord preserved and delivered me; blessed be His holy name forever.

I had been at home but a little time, before John Whitehouse, a follower of John Perrot,
came and had a meeting at my house at Welch-Pool.
I happened to not be at the beginning of the meeting, but came before it concluded,
and found he had sown an evil seed, and that some of our Friends had received it.
These soon after joined with that corrupt spirit,
which led them to have a light esteem of their brethren,
which was a great exercise to many honest Friends, and especially to my wife and me.
We were ready to say, "`Has the Lord sent us here
to be instrumental for the gathering of a people in this country,
and yet allowed the enemy to scatter them in their imaginations?`"
But some time after, the Lord satisfied me by assuring me
that those who were simple-hearted among the deceived
would be restored again into a more settled condition than they had formerly known;
and I believed in the word of the Lord.
And in time the Lord broke in among them, and opened the understandings of some of them.
These began to reason among themselves, and saw that they were in darkness,
so that most of them were restored again into their first love
and lived and died faithful to Truth, except Cadwalader Edwards,
who continued in stubbornness and hardness of heart,
and endeavoured to hurt those who were simple-hearted.
I was moved to give forth a paper against him and all his vain imaginations,
and the following paper was likewise sent to him from Friends:

[.embedded-content-document.paper]
--

We whose names are here subscribed,
are those you have been seeking to insinuate your corrupt principles into;
and we are also those who testify against that seducing spirit that you have gone into.
Most of us do know the terror and judgment of the Lord, for receiving that spirit;
and we do exhort all, that they do not touch, nor taste of it,
lest they be separated from the Lord and His people,
and so come under the judgment of the Lord, as we have done.
We have all seen the hurtful effects of that spirit,
and in the fear of the Lord we do deny it, and those who are joined to it.

1668+++.+++ This being read in our monthly meeting for worship,
the Lord was pleased to afford us His sweet presence, and His power melted,
tendered and mollified our hearts, and caused us to praise the Lord
for His great goodness and mercy to us,
in bringing us out of that darkness that came over us
by giving heed to the seducing spirit of John Perrot, John Whitehouse,
and Cadwalader Edwards.
And the Lord now having restored us again, we did praise His holy name for the same;
and Friends were careful afterwards of receiving any spirit
that might tend to the breach of love and unity among us.
Many other Friends brought in their testimonies against that spirit; among the rest,
one came from our friend Thomas Ellis, who had been particularly warned by me,
in the fear of the Lord, not to touch or meddle with the spirit--though it came with much
seeming humility--lest he should suffer thereby. This he did,
to his great sorrow, as is described in his paper, where he said,
"`This I have suffered for seeking to mix what God had separated.`" But blessed be the Lord,
he was sweetly restored again to his former love and integrity,
to the great comfort of himself and his brethren.

As to John Perrot, John Whitehouse, and Cadwalader Edwards,^
footnote:[He became afterwards very bad, and ungodly in his life and conduct,
and died in the Fleet-prison, at London, being there for debt; yet near his end,
he seemed to repent of his wicked life, and told some,
that "`They who were preserved faithful among the people called Quakers, would be happy,`"
and that "`they were the people of God.`"]
they turned their backs upon God and His truth,
and followed the designs of their own hearts and imaginations.

About this time, there being a meeting of Friends gathered at Aberystwith,
in Cardingshire, most of them were sent to prison in Cardigan,
and our friend Thomas Ellis was taken prisoner with them.
Having the sufferings of these young convinced Friends under consideration,
I found much love in my heart towards them,
which led me to go to the magistrates of the county
to offer myself as a prisoner in the place of my friend and brother Thomas Ellis,
and some others, that they might go home to visit their families.
I acquainted my wife with my exercise, which came pretty close to her;
but she likewise, in love, after a little consideration, gave me up for that service.
So in a few days I took my journey, and went first to Thomas Ellis`'s house,
to visit his wife and family, before I went further,
his house being about twenty-four miles from Welch-Pool,
and not far out of my way towards Cardingshire.
There I very unexpectedly met Thomas Ellis himself at home;
he told me they were all discharged out of prison.
Thus I saw it was the good will and pleasure of my heavenly
Father to accept my free-will offering instead of the deed;
and my friend Thomas Ellis and his wife were
sensible of my love and kindness to them therein.

And now being bound for Pembrokeshire in my service,
Thomas Ellis was willing to accompany me in my journey, and we went to Aberystwith,
to visit those Friends there,
where we had a pretty large meeting on first-day in the morning.
To this meeting came one Thomas Price, brother to Sir Richard Price, of Gogorddan,
who took us all prisoners, and committed us to the town prison.
That evening we had a meeting in the house where we
were prisoners.
Many of the town`'s people, some of them people of account,
were at the meeting that evening.
I declared the word of the Lord to them in Welch,
and showed them the way to the kingdom of heaven.
A sweet, comfortable meeting we had, and it was a great satisfaction to those who were there.

That night a weighty consideration came upon me,
about those young convinced Friends who were so soon discharged from their imprisonment,
because they were likely to be so quickly put in prison again.
So I asked counsel of the Lord, what we might do for and on behalf of
these young and tender Friends; and being under a great exercise in my spirit,
earnestly praying to God that He might make some way for their freedom at that time,
it came to my mind to write to the chief magistrate, Sir Richard Price,
and give him an account of my journey so far--that my friend Thomas Ellis
and myself being bound for Pembrokeshire,
and resting with our friends and having a meeting with them that day,
we had been taken prisoners by his brother Thomas Price;
and if it was his pleasure to send us to prison in Cardigan,
to ask of him if he would be so kind as to leave our neighbours at home,
and accept my friend Thomas Ellis and me as prisoners, instead of them all.
To this effect I wrote to him, and sent it the next morning; but he sent me no answer.
But the high-constable came to us, and told us
we must all prepare to go to Cardigan town, where the county jail was kept.
So Friends freely and heartily prepared themselves to go.
When the time of our departure had come, they tenderly taking leave of their wives,
children, and neighbours,
(for some of their neighbours came a little way
to see them out of town,) the constable stopped,
and bid all go home, except Thomas Ellis and me;
for it seemed the high-constable had private orders not to leave with them all,
but to do as I desired in my letter.
Thus the Lord did try those tender Friends, and also deliver them.

The constable had instructions to bring us to the quarter-sessions,
then held at Llanbedar, and not to Cardigan.
When we came there, we were summoned before the justices, they being upon the bench;
some of them were formerly acquainted with Thomas Ellis, he having been in authority,
and according to his station, somewhat sharp against offenders.
The justices were very moderate to him;
but the clerk of the peace was very peevish and unyielding.
I asked the justices whether that man that questioned my friend
was a justice of the peace; they told me he was not.
Then I told them, we were not bound to answer him; but if they would give me permission,
I would give them a just account of my business in that county,
and upon what account we were sent there before them: and they desired me to speak on.

I told them I was at my own house with my wife and family, in Welch-Pool,
in Montgomeryshire, and hearing that my friend Thomas Ellis, and others of my friends,
were in prison in this county of Cardigan for a considerable time,
it was upon me to come to the magistrates of this county, to offer myself as a prisoner,
so that my friend Thomas Ellis, and the rest of them,
might go for a little while to visit their families. For this reason,
I came as far as my friend Thomas Ellis`'s house,
where I found him at home with his wife and family;
and they being discharged from their imprisonment,
I had a further concern upon me to go to Pembrokeshire; my friend Thomas Ellis,
not being willing I should go alone, accompanied me.
We came to Aberystwith, to rest there the first-day of the week,
and had a meeting with our friends. At this meeting we were taken prisoners, and sent
here before them,
and now we desired to know their pleasure.
The justices answered, "`It was great love indeed,
that caused you to come to offer yourself a prisoner upon such an account;`"
and they were sorry that Sir Richard Price gave us the trouble of sending us there:
and so they discharged us.
And the court being silent,
I had an opportunity to declare the word of the Lord among them.
They were very still and attentive, as if I had been in a meeting.
I commended their great moderation, and in the love of God we parted with them.
The deputy-sheriff, and the high-constable that brought us there,
came out of the court and treated us very civilly,
and would have bestowed on us the best that the town could afford,
but we were reluctant to take anything from them.
I was informed that the deputy-sheriff and the high-constable were convinced,
and very loving to Friends all along.
I know not of any who were imprisoned in that county afterwards.
The Lord was with us, and He had a regard to the integrity of our hearts,
and He alone pleaded our cause, and was with us in our services.

Then we took to our horses and left the town, and went towards Pembrokeshire,
till we came to Cardigan, a distance of about twenty-four miles.
We met with some hardship on the way, having little or no refreshment till we came here,
where we had very good lodging for ourselves and our horses.
From there we had a Friend for our guide toward Pontchison in Pembrokeshire,
but the sky grew dark, and it rained; our guide lost his way,
and we wandered up and down among the peat (or turf-pits), and other dangerous places,
but the Lord preserved us out of them all.

At length we came to Pontchison, but it being dark,
we did not know where to find the house of the Friend we intended to lodge with,
but I spoke to our guide to see where the steeple-house door was,
and he brought us to it; then I told them the Friend`'s house was opposite to it,
for I remembered when I had a meeting there, my back was against the wall of the house,
and my face towards the steeple-house door.
So we went forwards and found the house.
I desired Thomas Ellis to call and tell them,
that there were some Friends who had lost their way,
and desired to have lodging there that night.
They being in bed, answered that
they thought no good Friends were out at that time of night.
Thomas Ellis reasoned a little with them,
but still they were not willing to rise and let us in.
At last I called to the Friend, whose name was Thomas Simmons, and to his wife,
and desired them to rise and let us come in.
He asked me, "`Who is there?`"
I told him in Welch, "`Richard Davies is here;`" "`What,`" said he,
"`Richard Davies of Welch-Pool?`"
I told them I was the man.
Thereupon the tender, loving Friends hastily came down and let us into their house,
and we were satisfied in the love of God.
This was the first journey that Thomas Ellis made to Pembrokeshire since he was convinced.

From here we went to Haverfordwest, and so through all the meetings in that county,
till we came to Pontchison again and had a meeting there,
which many Friends came to, both Welch and English,
so that the house could not contain us,
and we had the meeting out of doors in the street.
I declared the word of the Lord to them, both in Welch and English.

As we came to Pembrokeshire, we went to a Baptist`'s house,
and the woman of the house being loving and tender,
promised we should have a meeting among the Baptists there.
We also appointed a meeting at Newcastle, in Carmarthenshire. Peregrine Musgrave,
James Lewis, and several other Friends accompanied us to the meeting at Newcastle.
The magistrates of the town were very civil, and several of them came to the meeting.
The weight and service of the meeting lay chiefly upon me;
for though our friend Thomas Ellis was reckoned a deacon,
and an eminent preacher among the Independents,
his mouth was but very little opened by way of testimony among Friends as of yet.
He was a man of understanding in the things of God,
and was not hasty to offer his offering, till he found a very weighty concern on him.

As I was declaring to the people in the Welch language,
I stood opposite to a great window that opened to the street,
and there was an evil-minded man in the street who had a long gun,
and he put the mouth of it through the window and swore, that if I would speak another word,
I was a dead man.
But blessed be God, I was kept in that which was above the fear of man,
and the Lord kept me in dominion over all.
There were two women sitting in the window,
and the mouth of the gun came between them both; one of them seeing the gun,
turned her back upon it, and said in Welch, when the man threatened as before,
"`I will die myself first.`"
And there was one in the meeting who went to this man, and took the gun away from him,
and that wicked man came into the meeting, and was pretty quiet there.
The Lord`'s good presence was with us, and a good meeting we had; and I may say,
"`They that trust in the Lord, are as Mount Zion, that cannot be moved.`"
And as it was said of old, "`As the hills were round about Jerusalem,
so is the Lord round about his people,`"
to be a present help to them in every needful time.

Here we and the Pembrokeshire Friends parted, and it being somewhat late (
the meeting having held long), we travelled all night over some doleful hills,
intending to be at the Baptist meeting the next day, which we had appointed,
as before mentioned.
It was by computation a distance of about twenty-four miles.
During this time we had little refreshment for ourselves and our horses,
but when we came there we had no meeting.
The woman of the house said that the magistrates had heard of it, and charged them
that we should have no meeting there;
so the slavish fear of man came over them.
The woman seemed to be sorrowful, and would have given us some food, but I told her,
we did not travel so hard to come there for her food and drink, but in the love of God,
for the good of their souls.

So here my friend and companion Thomas Ellis and I parted; he went homewards,
and I went that night to William ap Pugh`'s house, a poor Friend,
who had a considerable number of small children.
I lay on a little straw, upon a hurdle of rods.
When the morning appeared, I took a bit of cake and a cup of clean water,
and William ap Pugh and I took our journey towards Radnorshire,
which was a distance of about twenty miles, mostly over great hills: and when I came there,
I stayed a little while among Friends.

Afterwards I hastened home to my family, and when had I come there,
Margaret Bowen brought my girl to me, and said, "`Here is a child the Lord has given you;`"
for she had been sick near unto death.
When I was under my exercise in Pembrokeshire, one told me my child was dead,
and my wife not likely to recover; which was a matter of sorrow to me.
But upon withdrawing a little from Friends to seek His counsel, the Lord satisfied me,
that neither my wife nor child was dead.
When I came home they told me my child had been, as it were, raised from death to life.
Blessed be the Lord who restored her, and preserved my family.
After this we were comforted in the Lord.

After this journey I stayed a considerable time at home with my family and friends;
our meetings were pretty much filled with Friends,
especially from the north of England; and though we were prisoners,
yet we had our liberty to go to meetings abroad.
We had a considerably large meeting at Cloddiecochion, the place of my abode,
near Welch-Pool. To our meeting came John ap John, and James Adamson,
a north country Friend.
But the meeting taking place within the limits of their corporation,
the magistrates of Pool came and broke it up and took us prisoners.
We who had formerly been prisoners went back to the county prison,
and the rest were taken to the corporation prison.
I took my friend John ap John by the hand, and told him he must
come with me to the county prison.
So several of us went there together,
and when the commotion with the others was over,
they caused us, who had formerly been prisoners, to remain in our prison house,
but allowed all the others to go free.
I then dismissed our friend John ap John, and told him he
should no longer be my prisoner.
He stayed a little while with us, and then went homewards.
The jailer was friendly to us, and after a while I went to the magistrates,
and got all of the Friends released that night, except James Adamson.
The magistrates of the county gave strict charge,
that if any north-country Quakers came that way, they should be imprisoned;
and I had a great concern upon me to get this Friend discharged as soon as might be,
for I knew there was a great concern upon him
for the churches of Christ wherever God sent him.
So when I saw a convenient time, I went to the Sergeant of the town,
and asked him by what authority he kept my friend a prisoner there,
and whether he had a commitment upon him.
He told me "`No.`" Then I desired him to let the said Friend come with me, and I would be
responsible for him;
so the Friend came to my house, and Friends and I concluded together
to let him go to Shrewsbury, which was about twelve miles from Welch-pool;
and I desired him to stay there till he heard from me.

The court sessions being held there a few days after, the chief magistrate of Pool went,
and I went also.
And as my friend James Adamson and I were walking under the hall at Shrewsbury,
we met the magistrate of Welch-Pool, to whom James was a prisoner.
He seemed a little angry because I sent the prisoner away, and asked me
what I could answer for it: "`for,`" said he, "`we sent to the lord Herbert of Cherbury,
for a commitment upon him.`"
I told him, they had kept him too long without a commitment,
which they could not legally answer.
Now he knew not that the prisoner was with me, so I asked him after some discourse
what he would give me for a sight of the prisoner; he considered, and asked me
whether the man that was with me was his prisoner?
I told him he was, for I knew he was then out of the magistrate`'s jurisdiction.
So he said to the Friend, "`Your friend has done you and me a kindness; and I see,
if there had been any occasion you would have come back again;`"
so he parted with us in much friendliness.

In these times the oath of allegiance and supremacy was
tendered to most Friends that came into the county, if they were arrested,
and such were committed to prison for not taking it
till the next court sessions, and then premunired; and
then there was little hope of their being released from their imprisonment.
Thus it came to be a saying,
that when any Quakers were taken prisoners in Montgomeryshire,
there would be no end to their imprisonment.

About the year 1669, my ancient, well-beloved, and dear companion, John ap John, and I,
took our journey for South Wales, to visit our friends and brethren in those parts.
We went first into Radnorshire, where we had several good meetings.
We gave timely notice beforehand where we appointed the meetings,
and several Friends and other people came from Herefordshire
to meet us at the lower end of the county of Radnor,
where we had a sweet, living meeting,
and the power of the Lord tendered the hearts of many.
We declared the word of the Lord both in Welch and English.

My friend John ap John was very sound and intelligible in the Welch language.
He deserved the right hand of fellowship, for he was my elder,
and the first Friend that I heard speak in a meeting in the English tongue.
And though he was not perfect in that language, yet he had the tongue of the learned,
to such who were spiritual.
When that meeting was ended in Radnorshire, we both withdrew a little from Friends,
being bowed before the Lord, in a sense of His goodness among us.

After a little while I turned my face towards where the Friends were gathered,
and saw a man coming towards me with much brokenness and many tears; and when he came to me,
he took me in his arms and held me there.
I was very tender of him, though I knew him not.
He asked me whether I knew him or not; I told him I did not; though I said
something about him was familiar to me.
He said, "`I have cause to remember you.`"
When I looked upon him again, I asked him if he was not Roger Prichard. He said,
"`I am the man that went astray.`"
And I was glad, yes, very glad, that the lost sheep was found,
and that he came to know the true Shepherd and His voice in himself; and he followed Him,
and went not astray again, as he did before.
He accompanied us to several meetings in that county, and in Monmouthshire.
As we were parting with him, John ap John told him
he had come far out of his way with us.
He answered that we had put him in his right way again, and he hoped he should keep in it.

We went through Monmouthshire and Glamorganshire, visiting Friends.
We had a good meeting at Scilly, and at Swanzey in Glamorganshire,
where we met with some French Britons.
We could understand something of their language,
and found they were zealous among themselves.

From there we passed to Carmarthenshire.
We had a meeting at Cardiff, and lodged at John Mayo`'s;
his wife Elizabeth was a nursing mother to Friends in the beginning.
At Cardiff, and in other parts of that country, John ap John had suffered great persecution
before I was convinced. I suppose he might have been prisoner there in 1653, or 1654.

We went from there towards Pembrokeshire, where we had several good meetings,
and the Lord was with us.
Then we came homewards; and before we parted with Roger Prichard,
we appointed a meeting at his house, which was in Almeley-Wooton.
The Lord helped us on in our journey, and we came there at the appointed time,
and a large, sweet, comfortable meeting we had:
I do not know if any meeting had been there before.
I appointed another meeting to be there; and in a few weeks after my return home,
I went accordingly.

A concern for that part of the county of Herefordshire was much upon me,
and I was often there; and when the people of that village saw me come,
they would say one to another, "`Come, let us go to Mr. Pritchard`'s,
for we shall have prayers there tonight;`"
and the house has soon been nearly full of people.
A comfortable time we used to have together,
and many were gathered to the Lord in those parts.
As for Roger Prichard, the Lord blessed him "`in his basket and in his kneading bowl,`"^
footnote:[Deut. 28:5]
and his heart and house were open to Friends,
and he built a fine meetinghouse at his own charge, and also a burying-place,
and gave both to Friends for that service,
and lived and died in love and favour with God, and in unity with his brethren.
"`Say to the righteous,
that it shall go well with them.`"^
footnote:[Isai. 3:10]

About this time I was pretty much at home,
and the enemy and adversary of the growth and prosperity of Truth in these parts,
stirred up an informer^
footnote:[Because of the political insecurity of the times,
a law had been passed forbidding all religious gatherings
except those taking place at the times and places authorized by the state.
A monetary reward was offered by the government to any who would disclose
the existence of an unauthorized religious meeting (called a conventicle).
Those who "`snitched`" or betrayed their neighbors
in this way were called __informers,__
and were generally looked down upon by honest members of society.]
against us, one John David, alias Pugh, a weaver,
and a tenant to the jailer.
We had our meeting in an upper room in the prison, and the said informer dwelt below.
Once as he was coming by my barns where my cattle were, he said to some of my neighbours,
"`These cattle are all mine.`"
They asked him, how they were his; he said,
"`Richard Davies has preached three times this day,`"
and that by law a preacher is fined sixty pounds for the same.
By this it was noised abroad in the town, that I was likely to be undone.
My neighbours seemed to be concerned, and one of the aldermen, a relation of mine,
came chidingly to me, and asked me whether I had a mind to ruin my wife and family;
could I not leave my preaching, when I knew the laws were so severe against us?
I told him, I could not, when the Lord required it of me.
I desired him to let the informer alone, and let him take his course.
He said he would not; "`but,`" said he, "`I will tell you what I will do:
I will take him along with me to Severn-side, and whet my knife very sharp,
and I will cut off one of the rogue`'s ears; and if ever he informs against you again,
I will cut off the other.`"
I earnestly desired him to let him alone;
but he and his neighbours were so enraged against him,
that I was afraid they would have done him some mischief.
This informer was a weaver by trade, and the neighbours took their work away from him,
so that his children went begging soon after, many of the town telling them,
their father had taken a new rich trade in hand,
and that they did not need to give them anything.
So the poor children suffered very much;
but my wife did not withhold her hand of charity from them.

One time, I being in the street with my boots on, ready to go out,
the jailer (this informer`'s landlord),
seeing him come up the street towards my house,
said to him, "`Mr. Informer,
you see Richard Davies is going out to preach somewhere today;
I advise you to look diligently after your business, and find him out.
If you will not inform against him, I will inform against you.
You have got a good trade in hand, and if you do this great service for the king,
you must have either Dolebran, or Coedcowrid, for your labour.`"
The one was the mansion-house,
and the other the jointure-house that belonged to my friend Charles Lloyd,
and his ancestors.
Thus the jailer jeered him, and the poor informer travelled a great part of that day,
from one Friend`'s house to another, to search for me, till he came to Dolobran,
where we were met upon church affairs.

As we were coming from the meeting, I met him at the door,
and discoursed a little with him.
He told us that he was going to Edward lord Herbert for a warrant against us,
but I felt the power of God was over him, and Truth reigned among us.
He went to the said lord, and desired a warrant against the Quakers.
Lord Herbert asked him, "`What did the Quakers do?`"
He said they preached.
He queried of him, "`Where did they preach?`"
He told him, they preached at his house, which was their prison.
Lord Herbert answered,
"`Let them preach there as long as they will, what have I to say to them?`"
But the informer told him, they met at Cloddiecochion.
He asked him, whether those were not prisoners; he answered they were.
Then said lord Herbert,
"`What do they do at Cloddiecochion? Do they preach there?`"
He said, "`No; their custom is to sit down, and look upon each another.`"
He answered, "`You are but a fool; the Quakers are a loving people;
they went to visit their children, and to eat bread and cheese with them.`"
So lord Herbert took his cane and left him, to walk with his gentleman in his park.
The informer followed them, and spoke again to him, and said,
"`Will you be pleased to grant me a warrant against the Quakers?`" He asked him,
"`Who sent you here for a warrant?`"
He said, "`D. Davies.`"
This was the priest of Welch-Pool, a quiet man, and no persecutor.
Lord Herbert asked him again, whether he had a letter from him; the informer said, "`No;
I thought my word might be sufficient to get a warrant against the Quakers.`" Upon this,
lord Herbert, with indignation, it was thought, would have harmed him,
had not his gentleman interposed.
He said to him, "`Is it not sufficient to put my peaceable neighbours in prison?
Must I give a warrant to make such a rogue as this rich,
by ruining them and their families?`"

So the informer returned home; and as I was going by his house,
he desired me to step in, for he had something to say to me.
I went in with him, and he said to me, "`I am sorry I did you so much wrong,
for I intended much evil against you.
I was incited to be an informer, which proved to be mine and my children`'s ruin;
for my neighbours took their work from me, and when my children went to their doors,
they would scarcely give them anything to relieve them.
And now I desire you to pray to God to forgive me; and I pray that you would forgive me also;
for I think most of our bishops are Papists, and there is no trust to be put in them.`"
I desired him to have a care what he said, and not lay the fault there:
for it was the enemy--the adversary and devil--who begot that covetous mind in him,
against his peaceable neighbours.
I desired the Lord to forgive him; and as for me and my friends, we would forgive him;
and I desired him to go his way, and to do so no more.
So he never informed against us afterwards.

Thus the Lord helped and preserved us through great hardships and difficulties.
There was nothing taken from us at this time, upon this informer`'s account.

About the year 1675,
we heard there was a severe persecution by informers in Merionethshire,
especially in Penllyn, near Bela; during time our meetings increased there,
and many people came to them.
A concern lay upon my friend Charles Lloyd and me to visit those meetings,
and accordingly we had a meeting on the first-day of the
week at Cadwalader Thomas`'s, called Wern-fawr.
There was an abundance of people--more than the house could hold.

Two informers came in, and stayed all the meeting-time;
and after Charles Lloyd and I had cleared ourselves by way of testimony,
the people`'s understandings were very much opened in the things of God,
and the way to His kingdom, which was preached
in the Welch language. In this language I concluded the meeting,
the Lord acknowledging us with His great power and presence, to our great comfort,
and the satisfaction of the audience.
The two informers kneeled upon their knees with us, while I was at prayer,
and one of them, called Robert Evans, trembled exceedingly;
and when I had concluded the meeting,
the said Robert Evans took a paper out of his pocket,
and stood before us with much trembling and shaking, and could say nothing to us,
but "`A warrant, a warrant, a warrant.`"
Friends stood quiet in the possession of that life and
power which God had blessed them with that day,
and we said nothing to him, nor he to us,
which was almost an amazement to the spectators; for he was a spiteful, envious man,
who had done much harm to Friends in those parts.
At last I asked him what he had there; he told me, he had a warrant.
I desired him to let us see it.
He was not willing we should see it; but said,
if we would come a little farther on our way, we should see it.
We told Friends we were not bound to follow him,
and desired Friends to depart to their own habitations.
But our loving, tender-hearted Friends would not part with us.

Charles Lloyd and I had a great desire to see what the tenor of the warrant was,
and who the justices were that signed it.
So we went along with him to the house where he said we should see it;
but the man of the house not being within, Evans was still unwilling we should see it.
We told him he would have it returned safely again, and at last he let us see it:
and we saw that colonel Price of Rhiwlas, and colonel Salisbury of Riig, had granted it.
We went that night to John Thomas`'s of Llaethgwn,
and were concerned to go and visit these justices.
In the first place we went to see whether we could speak with Price of Rhiwlas,
to lay the sufferings of Friends (who were his neighbours and tenants) before him,
for many of them were his tenants; but we could not see him,
though we heard he was at home.
From there we went to Riig, where this colonel Salisbury lived;
and we enquired before we came to the house whether he was at home; some told us he was,
but when we came there, they perceived we were those people called Quakers,
by our clothing and language, and he being conscious himself of what he had done,
and what harm was made upon Friends`' goods, he would not admit us to speak with him.
We desired one of his servants to tell him
that we had come a great way to visit our suffering Friends in that country;
and my friend Charles Lloyd bid the servant to tell him who he was;
for it seems he was his relation, and old schoolfellow.
From there we went to John ap John`'s at Wrexham, in Denbighshire,
and visited Friends there; and then came home to our families,
where we found all things well; and the Lord was with us in our journey.

Some time after this it lay upon me to go and visit Friends in London.
I went to see the lord Powis and his lady who dwelt then at London (they being my
particular friends), and acquainted them with the sufferings of our Friends in Merionethshire,
by informers upon the late act.
They asked me in what way they might be helpful to Friends; I told them,
if they would be pleased to get a few lines from their brother the duke of Beaufort
(then lord-president of Wales), to send to colonel Price of Rhiwlas,
I did not doubt that would moderate them very much:
for the said colonel was not on the whole a persecutor,
but was prompted to it by some peevish clergyman, so called.
In a little time they wrote his letter for me, with his own seal thereon,
but not sealed up; the tenor of it was thus: "`Sir,
I have stopped the complaint of his Majesty`'s subjects, called Quakers,
from coming before the council-board,
concerning the severe prosecution of the penal laws against them.`"
So when I had this letter, I made what haste I could down into the country,
and gave it to a Friend and relation of colonel Price`'s,
who delivered it into his own hand.
It had a good effect;
the Lord was pleased thereby to stop the rage and ruin
that was intended against Friends in that county.
The justices of the peace called the informer to give an account of
what he had done to--and taken from--Friends, but he could not make up his account.
The moderate justices followed him so close, on behalf of the king,
that he was nearly ruined and undone thereby.
So it pleased God that he himself fell into the snare and
evil that he intended against his neighbours.

Some time afterwards, one Price, priest of Llanvawr, in Merionethshire,
was severe against Friends for tithes,
and some Friends came down to me in Welch-Pool with an account thereof.
I considered his proceeding upon a quo minus from the exchequer,
and caused an attorney to appear for the Friends, and he, in few terms,
brought me an official list of charges against the priest.
When I had it, I was in a great strait what to do with it;
for I knew if the priest were convicted, it would exasperate him against Friends.
I sent for some of these Friends to be at our quarterly-meeting at Dolobran,
which they belonged to.
I told them what my judgment was in the matter;
and that though there was a list of costs obtained against the priest,
yet it was not expedient to have it executed.
I told them I thought it would be more convenient for them to take the list,
show it to the deputy-sheriff, and tell him the whole case;
but to take care that the list should not be left with him; which was well approved of,
and the Friends did accordingly, and kept the list.
The deputy-sheriff knew that would be for the advantage of Friends,
and was ready to do what he could for them.
So he spread it abroad that the Quakers had gotten an official list against the priest;
and the poor priest was afraid of coming to the steeple-house
for several days to perform his service,
till he employed somebody to come to Friends to make an end of the matter;
and I never heard that he troubled Friends again for tithes while he was there.

About the time that I was at London visiting Friends, there sprung up a new informer,
whose name was David Maurice; he lived at a place called Pen-y-bont, in Denbighshire,
and was newly made a justice of the peace of the county of Montgomery.
He who recommended him was informed that he was a sober man,
and not given to persecution; but soon after he had his commission,
he appeared to be a great persecutor, not only of our Friends,
but of other dissenters also.

The said David Maurice, upon the 7th day of the first month, called March, 1675,
came into a meeting at Cloddiecochion, with about fourteen or fifteen persons,
most of them armed,
where a small number of our Friends were waiting in silence upon the Lord.
He requesting us to depart,
our friend Thomas Lloyd requested of him a quarter of
an hour`'s time before our being dispersed,
which he readily granted, and he with his followers sat among us.
Thomas Lloyd uttered a few words by way of defining the true religion,
and what the true worship was; all of which David Maurice approved of as sound,
and according to the doctrine of the church of England; yet notwithstanding,
he fined Thomas Lloyd twenty pounds for preaching,
though he was no magistrate of the corporation, and he fined the house twenty pounds,
and five shillings a-piece for the hearers.
And on the 16th of the fourth month, 1675,
he caused four cows and a mare to be driven from Thomas Lloyd,
all worth about sixteen pounds, by two of his servants (one of them being his clerk,
and the other his tenant), and no officer of the corporation, nor of the parish,
nor of that allotment of the hundred, were in accord with them.
These servants were lurking near the ground about two hours before day,
and drove away the cattle before sunrise,
and they were brought out of the county into his own domains.

The same day, at about dawn, the said drivers,
by a warrant from the said David Maurice, rudely broke through a neighbour`'s fields,
to the grounds of Thomas Lewis, of Cloddiecochion, and drove from him six cows, two oxen,
and two heifers; alleging for his offence,
that the said Thomas Lewis permitted a meeting to be at his house,
though the said David Maurice was at that meeting himself,
and not only allowed it at the time, but approved of what was spoken there.

About the same time Charles Lloyd, of Dolobran,
had ten young beasts taken from him by John Jones of Golynog, an attorney at law,
who was overseer of the poor of the parish of Myvod that year,
together with the petty constable, etc. upon a warrant from the said David Maurice
(the only informer and busy justice upon this mercenary act in our borders),
for preaching at Cloddiecochion, within the liberties of Welch-Pool,
the 14th of the first month, 1675,
though the said Charles Lloyd was not at that place that day,
nor at any meeting for many days before or after.
David Jones of Branyard, for being a hearer at the said meeting at Cloddiecochion,
had a brass pan taken from him for his own proper fines,
and one cow for the pretended inability of others convicted,
upon a warrant from the said David Maurice, of Pen-y-bont.
But nothing was taken from me, though my family was at the meeting,
and I lived within the limits of the corporation.

I being at this time in London,
and my service there being pretty much at the same time as the said hard persecution,
my dear friend Charles Lloyd sent me up a full and
large account of the sufferings of Friends there,
by this wicked informer David Maurice; and when I had read and considered them,
I was under a great consideration
what way to take to prevent the further intended mischief of this man;
and I laid Friends`' innocent and faithful sufferings in
secret before the great God of heaven,
who has the hearts of all men in His hand, and may order them as seems good to Him.

After this, when the time of the quarter-sessions had come,
the clerk of the peace told the court he had received the new commissions.
These being read, this David Maurice, being then present,
and finding himself left out of comission, fell into a great rage and passion.

In a little time the said David Maurice went to London,
and was put into commission again; but being made high-sheriff of the county this year,
he could not act as a justice of the peace; and he fell into a great rage,
for the said office was likely to be chargeable to him.
So that year we had peace and quietness; and when his sheriff-ship was over,
he was crossing through a brook called Lynlleth, near his own house at Pen-y-bont,
and it was supposed his horse threw him,
and he was carried downstream into the river Tannat a considerable way,
and there miserably perished.
Thus the Lord helped us through all our afflictions and troubles;
and we see that they that trust in the Lord shall not be confounded,
but are as Mount Zion and cannot be removed; and as the hills are round about Jerusalem,
so is the Lord round about His people;
blessed and praised be His holy name forever and evermore says my soul.

In the latter end of the year 1674, I went to visit my ancient, dear friend George Fox,
who was a prisoner in Worcestershire; on my way I passed through Herefordshire,
and had some meetings there.
I stayed with my friend George Fox for some time.
He told me how he was taken prisoner,
and that he was indicted for refusing the oath of allegiance;
that he had been twice removed by habeas corpus to London; that he had his trial there,
and no error being found in his indictment,
he was returned back again to his prison at Worcester.
As he was opening his case to me,
I thought the errors found in his indictment might be sufficient to get him discharged.
I told him of a counsellor, Thomas Corbet, a friend of mine, then in London,
who was very excellent in finding out errors; so after some consideration,
he sent next post for a habeas corpus, which came down in a little time,
and the sheriff was given it. So we set forward--George Fox went in the coach
with the sheriff and clerk of the peace of Worcester,
and I rode on my horse alongside the coach. No other Friend was with us.

We came to London the 8th of the twelfth month, and when we came there,
several Friends were surprised that George Fox
had come there again, for he had kept the matter to himself.
He desired the Friends who had the management of the business before
to let me have a copy of the record, which was pretty difficult to be had,
for several thought it was to little or no purpose;
but George Fox was not satisfied till I had it.
I had acquainted counsellor Corbet with the whole case, as far as I could understand it,
before I could see a copy of the record; and about the tenth hour of the night,
William Mead came with me to counsellor Corbet with it.
When he had read it, he said there were several material errors in it;
which made William Mead consider how that could be;
and he desired the counsellor to show him one error.
The counsellor showed him several errors, and
William Mead seemed to wonder that such great errors
could not have been found out by other counsel.

The next morning, being the 11th of the twelfth month, we went to court,
where some other counsellors moved first on George Fox`'s behalf,
and they were quite strong and pressing on some points,
but they did not know of any errors in the indictment.
All this while counsellor Corbet was silent.
Counsellor Walcott was against George Fox,
and fearing lest they should find some errors in the indictment, he said
that the oath should be tendered again to George Fox;
upon which counsellor Corbet stood up and said
that they could not imprison upon a premunire.
Whereupon the chief justice Hale said, "`Mr. Corbet, you should have come sooner,
at the beginning of the term, with that plea.`"
He answered, "`We could not get a copy of the return, nor of the indictment.`"
The judge replied, "`You should have told us,
and we would have forced them to have made a return sooner.`"
Then said judge Wild, "`Mr. Corbet, you speak of general terms; and if it be as you say,
we have committed many errors at the Old Bailey, and in other courts.`"
Corbet was positive, that by law they could not imprison upon a premunire.
The judge said, "`There is summons in the statute.`"
"`Yes,`" said Corbet, "`but summons is not imprisonment; for summons is in order to have a trial.`"
"`Well,`" said the judge, "`we must have time to look in our books, and consult the statutes:`"
so the hearing was put off till the next day.

As we were going out of Westminster hall, some Friends were much troubled
that the Welch counsellor should put in such a plea,
contrary to the opinion of the judges, and all the counsellors; and some of them said
they thought George Fox would have been discharged,
if the counsellor had not put in that plea.
But honest George Fox said he had a fine trial, and was cheerful in his spirit.
I desired Friends to have a little patience,
for I thought the Welch counsellor could stand upon his own feet.
So I went to the hall again, and waited for counsellor Corbet till the court was up;
and when I found him, I told him,
he had started something which many thought he could not make good; and if so,
it would be a criticism upon me, and the Welch counsellor, as they called him.
He desired me to bring him that evening another copy of the record, besides that which he had.
So I got one, and went with it to him; and he wrote in the margin something in French,
and gave it me again, and desired me to go with it to Thomas Rudyard,
who was an attorney in London for George Fox,
desiring him to deliver the record that night to judge Hale;
and he would take the other himself to judge Wild.
Then, he thought, there would be little more discourse on the matter:
and so it happened.

For the next day they chose to let that plea fall,
and begin with the errors of the indictment; and when they came to be opened,
they were so many and so gross,
that the judges were all of the opinion that the indictment should be quashed and made void,
and that George Fox ought to have his liberty.
Upon which the following proclamation was made: "`If anyone has anything to say against George Fox,
let them come forth and they shall be heard, otherwise he is discharged.`"
And so he was set at liberty.

Counsellor Corbet, who pleaded this cause, obtained great fame by it;
for many of the lawyers told him, he had fought by something
which had not been heard of before, meaning not imprisoning upon a premunire.
And after the trial, a judge said to him,
"`You have attained a great deal of honour by pleading George Fox`'s cause this way in court.`"

As we were coming out of the court, I had an opportunity to speak to some from London,
and to reproove them for their unbelief;
because they could not believe that any good could come from that plea.
I was then of a mind, and still am, that the hand of the Lord was in it,
more than the wit and cunning of man;
for that trial put an end to all the premunires in the nation.
Our friends in this county of Montgomery,
had mostly been under a sentence of premunire for many years.
Our friend Charles Lloyd was not allowed to see his own house for several years,
although it was but five miles from Welch-Pool, where he was kept a prisoner.

And as for myself,
I was called a prisoner on that account for about seven years,
but was not closely confined in all that time,
but had my freedom and liberty to be at London, and in other places of the nation,
as my service led me, and as the Lord made way for me.
In this time I visited Friends pretty frequently in their sufferings.
So, "`good is the Lord, and good is His word,
and worthy is He to be praised by all who know Him, from henceforth and forever.`"

1677+++.+++ Some years after this trial of George Fox at London, counsellor Walcott,
who was a counsellor against him, was made judge of three counties in North Wales,
namely, Merionethshire, Carnarvonshire, and Anglesey.
He began his circuit in Bala, in Merionethshire.
He caused several Friends to be brought before him,
and tendered to them the oath of allegiance and supremacy.
He did not intend to proceed against them by premunire, but said,
the refusal of those oaths was high-treason,
and he would proceed against them upon that
statute for their lives at the next court session;
threatening that the men should be hanged, and the women burned.
He was a wicked, hard-hearted man, and intended to do much mischief against Friends,
if the Lord had not prevented him.
So Friends of that county acquainted us here with the whole proceeding of that affair.
It being the time that the parliament was sitting, Friends concluded
that our friend Thomas Lloyd should go up to London immediately;
and we desired him to inquire with counsellor Corbet what should be done in the matter,
who was then in London.
When counsellor Corbet heard of the business, he was much concerned,
for he was very well acquainted with this man Walcott, and said,
"`They might try us all in that way, if Popery comes up again; for they have,`" said he,
"`the writ __De Hceretico Comhurendo__^
footnote:[A law passed by Parliament under King Henry IV of England in 1401,
punishing heretics with burning at the stake.]
in force, which was executed in queen Mary`'s days,
for the burning of heretics, and has not been repealed to this day.`"
So counsellor Corbet and Thomas Lloyd went to the parliament-house,
and acquainted several parliament-men with it, and that session it was repealed;
and judge Walcott was spoken to in London. After this our friends were prosecuted no further,
but had their liberty. And, blessed be the Lord,
Friends had great peace and quietness in that county for a considerable time afterwards.
In a few years judge Walcott died, so there was an end of that persecutor.

In the year 1677, our friend John Burnyeat came to give us a visit in Wales,
and had a meeting at Machynlleth, in Montgomeryshire. To this meeting came an informer
(Oliver Maurice of Drain Llwdion, in Merionethshire), who caused a disturbance,
and went afterwards to William Pugh, of Mathafern, near Machynlleth,
a justice of the peace for this county.
Pugh was one of those who had his commission when David Maurice was turned out,
as before related, and who granted him a warrant. And he,
together with his bailiff and a constable,
upon meeting John Burnyeat and Thomas Ellis on the road, stopped them,
and seized their horses, with their saddles and bridles,
so that they were constrained to travel on foot.
John Burnyeat`'s mare died within an hour and a half after seizure,
and Thomas Ellis`'s horse died in the informer`'s hands in half a year`'s time;
in which time a disease also infected most of his cattle,
whereby he suffered a very great loss.
The said justice likewise fined several other Friends at the same time,
though they lived in another county.
Thomas Ellis dispatched a messenger to me at Welch-Pool, being about twenty-two miles away.
The next day, the lord Powis being at home at his castle of Powis, I went to him,
and acquainted him with what had occured, and he was very sorry.
I desired of him that he would grant me permission
to spread abroad that he had heard such and such things concerning the before-said justice.
"`Not only so,`" said he, "`but let Mr. Edmund Lloyd (this was a neighbouring justice,
and no persecutor) write to him and tell him
that I am angry with him for such proceedings.`"
So I went to my friend, the other justice,
and got him to write a few lines to the said William Pugh.
He wrote effectually to him, and I sent it away by night;
by which means the rest of the fines were stopped.
But John Burnyeat`'s mare was dead, as before related.

Some time after, there was in this county of Montgomeryshire a priest called Hughes,
in the parish of Hirnant. In this place also lived a Friend, an honest man,
whose name was John Rhydderch, who could not pay tithes for conscience sake.
This priest brought several actions against him out of the county court for tithes;
and the sheriffs bailiffs drove away several of his cattle,
for judgment of the county court.
Our friend being well acquainted with the deputy-sheriff,
acquainted him with the errors of the proceedings in the county court;
and the sheriff ordered the bailiffs to return to the Friend his cattle;
so the priest was in a great fret that he lost all that charge.
After that, the priest ordered the Friend to be sued at Ludlow court,
which was for the Marches of Wales.
This court was a great yoke and bondage to Friends in this dominion;
for all answers were to be given upon oath in that court,
which Friends could not do for conscience sake.
This priest followed the Friend with one contempt after another,
till it came to a writ of rebellion.
We let him go on as far as he could go, till the Friend was near to being taken;
our attorney giving us an account of it,
I desired the Friend to go to a Friend`'s house in Shropshire,
which was out of the jurisdiction of that court,
and stay there till he should hear from me.
I sent to London to John Lloyd (brother to Charles Lloyd of Dolobran),
who belonged to the chancery-office, and he sent me down a prohibition,
which I sent to the priest and his attorney.
The priest fell into a very great rage,
and his attorney came to him for seven pounds`' charge that he laid out for him,
but the priest would not pay him; the attorney sued him, and got judgment against him,
so that the poor priest could not go to perform his customary service for some time.
Soon after which the priest died,
and I know not whether the attorney ever obtained one penny of his money;
and that Friend was never troubled again on account of that suit.

Our friend Charles Lloyd, of Dolobran,
was sued for tithes at the great court session held for this county of Montgomery,
by the earl of Castlemain, impropriator, and Randal Davies, vicar of Myvod,
the parish that our friend Charles Lloyd lived in.
We believed it was a court of record,
and they might sue for triple damages for not paying tithes;
so we concluded to go with a copy of their declaration to counsellor Corbet,
who lived then at Welch-pool, and when he read it he said he would object to it.
I asked him whether he could object in the case of tithes?
He said, he would maintain an objection to that declaration.
So when the court sat, he told the judge that he would object to that declaration.
The judge said, "`Object in the case of tithes?`"
"`Yes, in this case,`" said he.
The judge asked him, whether he would object special or general?
Corbet said, "`When we join in objection you may know.`"
So they joined in objection; and when it came to be urged, he showed his cause of objection.
So the judge and the court were convinced of the error, and they paid the cost,
and mended the declaration,
and the next court session they obtained judgment upon _Nihil dicit._
So Charles Lloyd`'s cattle were driven away for triple damages;
but the priest was so perplexed, and put to charge and trouble,
that I do not know if he ever sued any Friend for tithes again.

After this I went to London to the yearly meeting, and continued there some time,
in and about the city, and so came leisurely homeward, visiting
with Friends at several meetings on my way.
A while after I came home, Thomas Ellis and James Halliday came to our town;
I told James it was good of him to give us a visit in these parts of Wales.
They said they came to visit us against their wills.
I asked them whether they were prisoners; they said they were.
Soon after other Friends came with them,
and I took them along with me to my house to refresh themselves.
They told me James Halliday came from London to South Wales,
intending to take shipping there for Ireland, to be at the half-year`'s meeting;
but the wind proving contrary, he was necessitated to come to Holyhead in North Wales,
and having a meeting in this county near Llanydlos,
they were taken prisoners and fined by Evan Glyn, a justice of the peace, and sent here.
I was very much concerned for James Halliday, that he should be stopped in these parts,
and hindered of his service.
So next morning at about two o`'clock,
I took my horse and went to this justice`'s father-in-law, justice Devereux,
and found him at a village three miles from Welch-Pool.
He asked me what the matter was; I told him,
that his son-in-law Glyn had committed some of our friends to prison at Welch-Pool,
and fined them also; and I told him, I thought by the law,
that no man was to suffer twice for the same supposed transgression.
He spoke harshly to his son-in-law, and desired me to find some way to obtain their freedom.
I went to a neighbouring justice, and got James Halliday a discharge,
and brought it with me that morning.
So we hastened him away with a guide towards Holyhead,
and I was informed he had a good and quick passage,
and got to the half-year`'s meeting in Ireland in time, as he intended.

Concerning Thomas Ellis and the rest of the Friends, the jailer took our word
that they would appear at the next quarter sessions.
When the time came, Charles Lloyd and myself attended the court,
and went to the clerk of the peace, and desired him to call our Friends first,
which he did.
The Friends being all at the bar, and no prosecutor appearing against them
(justice Glyn being not yet in town), they were soon discharged,
without any fees being demanded; and after Friends had refreshed themselves in town,
they went homewards, some of them towards Radnorshire.
Those that went towards Llanydlos, met justice Glyn, who had committed them,
going towards the quarter sessions.
He spoke to them, and they told him they were discharged.
He seemed not to be sorry for it, for he was not a persecutor at heart,
but was incited by a peevish, proud, informing priest.
I do not know that he ever persecuted Friends again.

I went to London to the yearly meeting in 1681.
Persecution was very severe upon Friends in the city, and elsewhere in those parts;
and at the meeting it lay upon my mind to urge for the appointment of a yearly meeting in Wales,
and after some consideration about it,
it was left in the hands of Friends in Wales to appoint their first yearly meeting,
as in the wisdom of God they should see fit, at their half-year`'s meeting,
held at Swanzey, the 28th of the seventh month.
An account of which my friend Thomas Ellis sent me to London, as follows:

[.embedded-content-document.letter]

[.salutation]
Dear friend, Richard Davies,

In the love of God is my remembrance of you at this time,
and of many others of the same mind, in and about the city,
and especially those who from the beginning have been--and still are--most exercised
under the glorious weight of the care and concerns of the church of Christ;
the remembrance of whom has several times, especially of late (and at present),
brought tears to our eyes, and tenderness to our hearts.
Although I was disappointed in my expectations of seeing you here
at this half-year`'s meeting, yet your letter to John ap John, coming so seasonably,
did so answer for your absence, that it was both a cause of joy and refreshment to many of us.
We had a full meeting of Friends from most parts of Wales,
many having come upon the account of the yearly meeting,
which was concluded to be at Haverfordwest, the second-day of the week,
called Easter-week, for the following year.
Here were E. Edwards, John ap John, W. Players, Francis Lea, Philip Leonard,
and Richard Walter, who had testimonies to share;
and many other Friends besides from other remote parts,
all zealous for the yearly meeting.
We had meetings here the three last days.

Your friend and brother,

Swanzey, the 28th of the Seventh month, 1681.

--

About the year 1680 or 1681, Dr. William Lloyd, late of Martin`'s, in London,
came to be bishop of this diocess, called St. Asaph.
Persecution was very sharp and severe in several places about this time,
upon account of excommunication, and the statute of 20 pounds a month.
But this new bishop thought to take a more mild approach,
by summoning all sorts of dissenters to discourse with him,
and seek to persuade them to turn to the Church of England.
Among the rest, when he came to Welch-Pool, in his visitation, he sent for us.
Charles Lloyd, Thomas Lloyd, and myself desired to speak with him,
but I was that day bound for London, and so could not.
Nevertheless my friends stayed till they had an opportunity with him;
and my friend Charles Lloyd gave me an account afterwards of what passed between them,
which was to this effect:

That the bishop was much displeased that I was absent;
and when he was told of my urgent occasion to go,
and my desire to return purposely some time to see him, he said, his business was greater,
whatever my business was.
That day they discoursed with him, his chaplains, and other clergy, so called,
from about two in the afternoon till two in the morning.
Afterwards they discoursed with him two days at Llanvilling.
The first day from about two in the afternoon till night; and the next day,
from about ten in the morning till an hour in the night, publicly in the town-hall.
The first day at Pool,
our friends Charles Lloyd and Thomas Lloyd gave their reasons for their
separation from the Church of England.
In none of the three days would the bishop and his clergy defend their own principles,
or refute ours; but during the three days they only held discourse
on the general principles of Christendom,
and the apostles`' examples of water baptism,
and once a short while concerning the bread and wine.
Thomas Lloyd spoke the last day, of our reasons why we separated from the Church of England;
which were:

[.numbered-group]
====

[.numbered]
1+++.+++ Because their worship was not a gospel worship.

[.numbered]
2+++.+++ Because their ministry was no gospel ministry.

[.numbered]
3+++.+++ Because their ordinances were no gospel ordinances.

====

But they would not join with him in proving any of them, though often solicited to do so.
Friends, being the sufferers, had to submit to all disadvantages;
for they had not any notice beforehand of what matters they
should argue till they came to the place of dispute.
The last day they forced Thomas Lloyd to answer about twenty-eight syllogisms extemporaneously,
all of which had been written down as they disputed; and the bishop said,
he had not expected so much could be said by anyone on that subject, on so little warning.
He also said, that he had not expected to find so much civility from the Quakers;
he highly commended Thomas Lloyd, and our friends came off with them very well.
They also had much discourse with the chancellor, and one Henry Dodwell,
and with the dean of Bangor, afterwards bishop of Hereford--very learned men,
who were also at the said dispute, along with many of the clergy of the diocese,
some justices of the peace, deputy-lieutenants of the county,
and a great concourse of people in the town-hall aforesaid, in Llanvilling.
Several of the clergy, with whom I afterwards discoursed,
seemed not well satisfied with that dispute; for they said,
they thought the validity of water-baptism was much weakened thereby;
and several noted men that were present said,
they thought there could not have been so much said
against water baptism as had been said there.
It was agreed by the consent of all parties concerned, that the dispute should not be printed.

I stayed a long while in London; and when the Lord made way for me,
I took my leave of the city Friends,
letting them understand that I was preparing homewards, intending for my prison,
upon the writ _De Excommunicato Capiendo,_ that was out against me and our Friends,
and other dissenters in this diocess called St. Asaph.
A little time before I came out of the city, there came two or three grave citizens,
I suppose of the Independent congregation, who told me,
they had come to let me know that there was a writ _De Excommunicato Capiendo_
out against me,
and one of their friends was already in prison on the same writ in our county;
and that if I would assist them, they said, they knew how to make it void.
I told them I knew that there was a writ out against me;
and I also knew there was a friend of theirs, one Richard Trolkis,
in prison in Welch-Pool on that writ.
I told them I believed they might make the writ void,
but I would contribute nothing towards it; for I told them
I would hasten home as soon as I could, and go to prison if required.
They said they were certain I had other reasons why I would not make the writ void,
and desired me to be free with them, and tell them my reasons.
I told them, I thought they might make that writ void with a great deal of charges; "`but,`"
said I, "`how will you prevent the bishop from coming on again with another writ,
which you cannot make void?
If there be any error in their proceedings in this,
no doubt the bishop and chancellor will mend it in the next.
And do you think it is better for me to go to prison on a false writ,
or on a writ that you can find no error in?`"
I also said, "`if I go to prison on this erroneous writ,
and the sheriff or jailer gives me my liberty,
the bishop or the chancellor cannot justly sue them.`"
These men went away well satisfied with the reasons I gave them,
and I know of no money they spent to make the writ void.

I told my friend William Penn, and some Friends,
that I intended to give bishop Lloyd a visit before I went to prison,
if the Lord pleased to make way for me.
So the morning before I came out of the city, my friend William Penn sent
me a letter from the lord Hide to the bishop,
with his coat of arms on it unsealed.
I took my journey and the Lord brought me safely home,
to the comfort of my family and friends,
who were afraid I had been detained from coming home.

The next morning I set out to see the bishop without interruption; and though the sheriff,
George Mercer, was very envious of Friends, yet I escaped his hands at this time.
I went to my friend Thomas Wynne`'s, who lived in Caerwys in Flintshire,
not far from the bishop`'s palace, and he went with me.
When we came there, the bishop`'s secretary came to the gate.
I asked him whether the bishop was within; he said he was, and asked me,
"`Who would speak with him?`"
I told him, that Richard Davies would speak with him.
"`What,`" said he, "`of Welch-Pool?`"
"`Yes,`" said I. "`What,`" said the secretary, "`my lord bishop!`"
"`Bishop, as it signifies an overseer,`" said I, "`I own; but lord bishop I deny.`"
So the bishop sent for us to come in, and there were several clergymen with him,
and among the rest the dean of Bangor, before mentioned.
The bishop seemed to be dissatisfied that I was
not with them at the dispute at Llanvilling,
and we soon began to dispute about water-baptism; I told them,
"`There was one Lord, one faith, and one baptism;`"
and that baptism was necessary for salvation; and that water-baptism,
which was John`'s baptism, was to continue and remain but for a season.
So this, and such like discourse, held us till it was late at night;
and then I went to my friend`'s house with an order to be there again in the morning.
I came in the morning, and we disputed upon the same subject.
I said, if one should grant what they desired, namely,
that water baptism was necessary for salvation, which I would not,
where should they have an administrator, seeing St. Paul says expressly,
"`He was not sent to baptise, but to preach the gospel;`" and thanked God,
that he baptized none, except such and such?
1 Cor. 1:14-17. And Peter, who baptized many,
came so to see the invalidity of water baptism, so that he said, "`By baptism we are saved,
not the putting away of the filth of the flesh,
(outward water could do no farther) but the answer of a good conscience towards God,
by the resurrection of Jesus Christ,`" 1 Pet.
3:21. They went from this subject to that of their ordination.
I challenged them to prove who sent them to baptise.
The dean told me, such a one ordained him; and so named one after another.
I told him I thought I should send him to Rome for their succession and ordination.
They said, "`Yes, the ordination might be good, though it came from Rome.`"
He brought a comparison: "`Suppose a malefactor was condemned to die,
and a reprieve was obtained, and it came from the hangman`'s hand;
and though it came so, yet,`" said he, "`the pardon was good.`"
"`Then,`" said I, "`your ordination comes not by the Spirit and power of God.`"
This return made them somewhat uneasy; and the time being far spent,
I was willing to be discharged, having been there part of three days.

I told the bishop of good old David, who said, Ps. 26:6,
"`I will wash my hands in innocency, so will I compass Your altar, O God;
that I may publish with the voice of thanksgiving and tell of all Your wondrous works.`"
Then I said to the bishop,
"`You can not say you will wash your hands in innocency, nor compass the altar of God,
while your writs remain against so many innocent people, willing to suffer till death,
for the testimony of their consciences towards God.`"
And I said, "`Bishop Lloyd, if I go to prison upon this account,
I shall have more peace there than you shall have in your palace.`"
I also said,
"`Suppose another prince should arise that would impose
something upon you that you could not do for conscience-sake,
what would you do?`"
He said, "`Then I will go to Pennsylvania also:`"
for at that time many Friends were about going there.
Then it came clearly to me, and I said to the bishop, "`Though your head be grey,
yet you may live to see liberty of conscience in England;`"
though as to outward appearance, it seemed to be very far from it at that time.

The bishop called for pen and ink, and said
he would write to the chancellor for my liberty; but I told him,
I was not satisfied in being myself at liberty, while my friends were in prison.
So he wrote to the chancellor, to suspend the execution of the writ.
When he had finished, he read the letter to me, and I acknowledged his kindness to us all therein.
Then I took lord Hide`'s letter out of my pocket, and gave it him.
When he saw the superscription, and knew from where it came, he asked me
how I had gotten it; I told him, "`As I was coming out of London, intending for prison,
a friend of mine brought me that letter the same morning that I left the city.`"
When he had read it, he said,
he hoped I was satisfied that he had granted me the contents of that letter.
I told him it was so, and I hoped he would have his reward for his well-doing.

Then I was dismissed, having leave to come home, and brought a letter to John Edwards,
chancellor, a peevish man against Friends, who lived at Llanymynech,
about eight miles from Welch-Pool.
When he received the letter, he did according to the bishop`'s order,
and those Friends in the diocess, that were concerned therein,
were not molested nor troubled on that account any more;
and the Friends that were in prison before, were discharged.
We have great cause to bless and praise the Lord for all His mercies, kindnesses,
and deliverances to us; for hitherto He has been our Ebenezer; that is,
"`the Lord has helped us,`" 1 Samuel 7:12.

In the beginning of the year 1682,
my dear friend Charles Lloyd and I went to visit Friends in Herefordshire,
Worcestershire, etc., and came through their meetings to London,
before the yearly meeting.
I told my friends George Whitehead and William Penn,
that I intended to go to lord Hide,
to acknowledge his kindness for his letter to bishop Lloyd on my behalf.
George Whitehead said,
there was some service to be done for our suffering friends in Bristol,
and it was thought convenient that three Friends of the city, and three of the country,
should go with a list of the said sufferings,
and desire the lord Hide in his kindness to present them to the king.
The three Friends for the country were Charles Lloyd, Thomas Wynne, and myself;
for the city, George Whitehead, Alexander Parker, and one more.
Our friend George Whitehead told me, that our countryman Sir Lionel Jenkin,
secretary of state, was so cross and ill-humoured,
that when the king was inclined to show moderation and tenderness to suffering Friends,
he often stopped and hindered the relief intended them.
When we went to Whitehall, we waited a long time before we could speak with them,
they being upon a committee a considerable time; but we had sent a message by the door-keeper,
to inform lord Hide that we were there; and in time they sent for us to come in.
The secretary looked grimly upon us.
I went to lord Hide,
and acknowledged his kindness for his letter to the bishop on my behalf.
He told me that I should tell the bishop, there would be liberty of conscience in England.
I told him I did say so; and did believe it would be so in God`'s time.
Secretary Jenkin spoke in a scornful manner, and asked me, "`What is Welch for a Quaker;`"
I answered him, "`Crynwr, Crynwyr;`" it being the singular and plural number.
But the secretary said, "`We have no Welch for it,
for there were no Quakers in the Romans`' days.`"
My friend Charles Lloyd answered, "`If you did ask my friend the question rightly,
he has answered you rightly; for there is English, Welch, Latin, Greek, and Hebrew,
for a Quaker.`"
So the secretary said, "`Sir, I understand Welch pretty well, and English, and Latin,
and Greek; but if you go to your Hebrew, I know not what to say to you.`"

I left my friend Charles Lloyd to engage with his peevish countryman,
and presented lord Hide with a long list of the names of men, women, and children,
in their several prisons at Bristol.
I desired him to be so kind as to present their sufferings to the king,
which he said he would; and our friend George Whitehead spoke further to him.
Then I turned to the secretary, who directed his words to me,
and spoke to him thus in Welch:

[.offset]
"`Mae yn ddrwg gennif, fod vn o Hiliogaeth yr hen Frittaniaid;
yr rhai ydderbyniodd y Grefydd Gristianogol yn gyntaf yd Loeger;
yn erbyn yr rhai sydd gwedi derbyn y wir Gristianogol Grefydd yr awr hon,`"

[.offset]
The English is thus:

[.offset]
"`I am sorry that one of the stock of the ancient Britons,
who first received the Christian faith in England,
should be against those who have received the true Christian faith in this day.`"

He replied, he was not against our friends; but, he said,
our Friends gave their votes for the election of
parliament men that were against the king`'s interest.
I told him, it was our birth-right, as we were freeholders and burgesses,
to elect men qualified to serve both the king and country; but how they were corrupted,
when they came within these walls, I knew not.
The secretary would have engaged further with me in a dispute about religion.
I told him, he was an ancient man,
and that they had been there a long time upon their business,
and if he would be pleased to dismiss us then,
and appoint a time some morning for us to wait upon him, we would, if he pleased,
spend an hour or two with him in discourse about religion.
Upon which he took off his hat, and thanked me kindly for my civility;
but we heard no more from him about the dispute.
Upon the whole,
our friend George Whitehead told me he was more moderate to Friends afterwards,
than he had been before.
The number of prisoners in the list delivered to lord Hide, to be presented to the king,
amounted in both prisons, to one hundred and thirty-nine;
of which there were eighteen aged women, from sixty and upwards, and eight children.
In the latter end of the list it was said, "`Blessed are the merciful,
for they shall obtain mercy.`"

I had several exercises this year, 1682, in London,
both from false brethren and otherwise.
Once I was at the Bull-and-Mouth meeting,
and there were several troublesome people in the gallery.
At this meeting none of our ministering brethren were in true unity with us,
but George Whitehead and William Gibson.
The gallery being pretty full, one of the people in it seemed to strive to keep me out,
but our friends George Whitehead and William Gibson perceiving it,
made way for me to come up to them.
Another of these troublesome people had been speaking for some time
in the meeting, and had made many weary of him.
I was under a great concern in my spirit for the honour
and exaltation of the name of the Lord and His truth,
and the ease of many who were under weights and burdens; yet, for quietness-sake,
I silently bore the weight and exercise that was upon me, till he had finished.
Then my mouth was opened in the name and power of God,
who had compassion on His afflicted seed,
and caused the light and life of His countenance to overshadow the meeting,
to the comfort and great satisfaction of the faithful.

I was made to detect the false doctrine, which one of them had delivered to the people,
namely, that the children of God are destroyed for lack of knowledge.
I told the people, that the children of God in these days,
were the children of the new covenant; and the covenant that He makes with them is
that "`They shall all know Him, from the least to the greatest;
and the true knowledge of God to His people in these days,
is life eternal,`" John 17:3, though Israel of old was destroyed for lack of knowledge,
because they forgot the God of their fathers, who brought them out of the land of Egypt,
and out of the house of bondage, insomuch that the Lord complained of them, and said,
"`The ox knows his owner, and the donkey his master`'s crib,
but My people do not know Me;`" Isa. 1:3. And elsewhere it is said,
"`They have forgotten Me days without number.`"
These were those apostates who the Lord complained had committed two evils;
they had "`forsaken Him, the fountain of living waters,
and hewn themselves cisterns, broken cisterns, that could hold no water.`" Jer. 2:13.
These were such as the apostle said,
"`When they knew God they glorified Him not as God, neither were thankful,
but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.
For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections and a
reprobate mind,`" Rom. 1:26. "`And the apostates in our days,`"
said I, "`have forgotten the God that first made them acquainted in measure with Him;
and so having lost the sense of His goodness,
have separated themselves from the love and unity of the brethren.
But the children of God,
who are faithful to the measure of the grace of God in themselves,
know it to be their teacher and leader into all truth.
These are not destroyed for lack of knowledge, though the world know Him not.
There are apostates in our age, who have lost the true knowledge of Him;
but the saints in light have, and remain in, the true knowledge of Him,
being guided by the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive,
because it sees Him not, neither knows Him; '`but you know Him, for He dwells with you,
and shall be in you,`'`" John 14:17. When I had thus eased my spirit,
a concern came upon our friend and brother, George Whitehead,
and he sweetly concluded the meeting in prayer.

After this I was pretty well cleared of the city, and was willing to draw homewards.
Next first-day I came to Jordans in Buckinghamshire, where we had a blessed meeting;
then I had one at Chesham; from there I went to Robert Jones`'s near Tring.
From there I went to the quarterly-meeting at Weston-Turfield, not far from Aylesbury,
where a concern opened in me,
to advise Friends to keep to those rules and methods
agreed on among us in our men`'s and women`'s meetings.
As I was speaking, an opposing party came in; I went on, however, and showed them
how it was agreed among the apostles to send chosen men, endued with the Holy Spirit,
to set up good order and method among them.
I told them that it seemed good to the Holy Spirit, and to us also,
to set up our men`'s and women`'s meetings,
so that the care and concern of the church of Christ might be upon holy,
self-denying men and women,
who might take care of the fatherless and widows in their
afflictions and keep themselves unspotted from the world;
which the apostle James says, "`is pure religion,
and undefiled before God,`" James 1:27. And that the care of all, both poor, strangers,
and prisoners in affliction, might be carefully and tenderly looked after,
and supplied according to their necessities;
and that the ministers of Christ in this day, might take the counsel of the apostle,
who said, Acts 20:28, "`Take heed therefore unto yourselves,
and to all the flock over the which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers,
to feed the church of God, which He has purchased with His own blood.`"

When I had ended what I had to say from the Lord among Friends,
one of the party stood up, and spoke something by way of criticism,
upon what I then delivered.
When he had finished, our friend Thomas Ellwood proposed to the meeting,
that all should sit down, and wait to feel the power of God among us,
and let that decide whether I did speak in the name and power of God among them this day;
to which the meeting agreed, and all were silent.
After which several Friends, as they were moved by the Lord,
tenderly gave their testimony, that what was delivered that day
was in the name and power of God, and that His presence was with us.
Among these were honest Robert Jones, and Richard Baker,
who loved the Lord and His blessed truth with all their hearts,
and several others present in that meeting.
Afterwards there stood up a young man who I knew not, whose heart was affected,
and much broken in spirit, and he said: "`There is a man come this day among us,
and I know not from where he came, nor where he goes; but of this I am satisfied--the Lord
sent him here, and His power and presence is with him,
and his testimony for the God of truth.`"
I enquired afterwards who that young man was; they said he was called John Thornton.

After this one of the party broke in violently and
disorderly against what had been agreed upon among us,
before the meeting had fully cleared themselves, and finished their testimonies;
but it proved greatly to his dishonour and disgrace,
so that he was made manifest to those who adhered to him.
The meeting held from about ten in the morning,
till (as they thought) ten or eleven at night.
But blessed be the Lord, who does not leave His people without a witness of Himself:
He is the preserver and defender of all His people who wait upon Him.
They that trust in Him are as Mount Zion, that cannot be moved.

After this I made what haste I could home, having meetings on my way at Banbury
and the surrounding country, and part of Worcestershire.
So, blessed be the Lord, I came safely home to my wife and friends,
where I found all things well: blessed be His name forever.

In the year 1683, I went again to London, to the yearly meeting,
and stayed there some time after most of the country Friends had gone out of the city.
I was moved one first-day, to go to Westminster meeting,
and there were no ministering Friends present but myself.
Several weighty matters opened in me at that meeting
concerning the church of Christ--what it was, and on what it was built.
I told them that some are of the judgment that the church of Christ is built upon Peter;
and I opened to the understanding of the people,
something of what is written in the 16th chapter of Matthew.
I showed them that that which revealed unto Peter
"`that Christ was the Son of God,`" was a manifestation of the Spirit of God in Peter,
for it is said, Matt. 11:27, "`No man knows the Son but the Father;
neither does any man know the Father, but the Son,
and he to whom the Son will reveal Him.`"
God revealed unto Peter, that Christ was the Son of God;
and He is the only rock that His church is built upon--the rock of ages,
the foundation of many generations, that the gates of hell never prevailed against.
But the gates of hell prevailed against Peter,
when he denied his Lord and Master in the time of His sufferings;
and therefore it was not likely that he was rock which Christ built His church on.
It is said, 1 Cor. 10:4, "`For they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them,
and that Rock was Christ.`"
So Christ is the sure foundation that His church is built upon.
Peter says, 1 Pet. 2:5, etc., "`You also, as lively stones,
are built up a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices,
acceptable to God, by Jesus Christ.`"
And in verse 8, he acknowledged Christ to be the Rock.
Paul says, 1 Tim. 3:15, that "`The house of God, the church of the living God,
is the pillar and ground of the truth.`"
"`This,`" said I, "`may inform the blind and ignorant of this age, that lime and stone,
and temples that are made with hands, are not, as they say, the church of Christ,
and the house of God;
'`for God dwells not in temples made with hands,`'
as says the prophet Isaiah, 61:1, and the martyr Stephen, Acts 7:48.`"

Thus I was concerned to declare the truth in that meeting,
with much more to the same effect.
After meeting I went with some Friends towards the city;
and as we were coming along the Strand, the queen was leaving her chapel,
and some of her lifeguard were very rude, and with the staves they had in their hands,
they did knock and beat Friends who had their hats on, all along as they came.
I received a blow upon my head, so that it swelled, and was sore for a considerable time.
But blessed be the Lord, in all our exercises and afflictions, His life, power,
and presence bore us up in the midst of them all;
praises be to His pure and holy name forever.

Before I came out of London, we met with more exercises and troubles.
One first-day in the morning, I was not well, and could not go to the meeting,
nor scarcely get out of my bed; but when the time of our afternoon meeting came,
it lay upon me to go to the Bull-and-Mouth; and I told Job Bolton, with whom I lodged,
that I must go to the said meeting.
He reasoned with me, but I told him I would go as far as I could,
and he said he would go with me.
As we went through the door to go in,
I heard a voice speaking that I was satisfied was not the voice of a true shepherd,
the meeting being already gathered, and many people there.

When I went up to the gallery, one was preaching on perfection, who said, "`Be perfect,
as your heavenly Father is perfect,`" etc.
I stayed to hear him but a very little while, till I stood up and judged him,
and told the people, that the kingdom of God stood not in words, but in power,
righteousness and holiness.
Then this man went in a rage out of the meeting, and a considerable company followed him.
A Friend or two went after them as far as Fleet Street, to see where they were going;
and one of the company saw the Friend, and desired him not to follow them too close,
lest they should treat him unkindly.
We heard afterwards there was a wager laid that this man, who some said was a Jesuit,
could preach in the Quakers`' meeting, without being discovered;
and had he gone without reproof, they would have said
that a Jesuit preached in the Quakers`' meeting, and they could not discern him.
But it was reported in many places in the city,
that he was detected in the Quakers`' meeting, and could not abide there.
We have cause to bless the Lord for His goodness to His people,
who gives them a discerning Spirit to judge between good and evil,
and between those who serve God in truth and righteousness,
and all deceitful hypocrites,
who are to be judged and condemned by the word of His power.

In the beginning of the year 1685, king Charles died, and king James came to the throne,
and the statute of 20 pounds per month for absenting from the public worship
(which I suppose was made against the Papists in queen Elizabeth`'s days),
had been and was very much put in force against our Friends,
whereby many of them were almost ruined.
The sheriffs and their bailiffs persecuted them so severely,
and made such a prey of them, that some Friends with many hundreds of pounds,
were made so destitute,
that they had scarcely a bed to lie upon, and were robbed of all.
When king James came to be settled upon the throne, our dear friend George Whitehead--
who always was much concerned for the sufferings of Friends up and down in the nation,
and who did not spare himself from visiting kings and parliaments, and all others,
where he thought he could get relief for his suffering brethren--went to king James,
and laid the present condition of suffering Friends before him.

After some consideration, the king told him that whatever concerned himself,
and whatever he received of those fines, he very freely and readily would remit.
Upon which an order was granted, to suspend the rigour of their persecutions.
But it seems, when it came out,
the Roman Catholics took the advantage of it to themselves;
which was some surprise to the Friends who had laboured to obtain it.
George Whitehead hearing I was in the city, came to me, and told me the whole business,
and understanding that I had business with the earl of Powis,
who was in great standing with the king,
he thought it might be of service if I would go along with him to the earl.

Next morning my friend George Whitehead and I went to
the earl of Powis in Lincoln`'s-inn-fields.
When he understood I had come in, he very soon came to me;
and when I had ended my country business with him,
I told him I needed a little of his advice,
in a case wherein our Friends were great sufferers by a law that was made against them;
for we had been greatly oppressed by a statue that exacted 20 pounds per month
for not coming to hear what they call divine service.
I told him that a friend of ours had waited upon the king,
and had told him the whole state of things,
and that the king was ready to relieve us in any way he could,
and an order had been granted to that purpose;
but it seemed his friends had taken the benefit of it, and excluded us, etc.
I desired his advice, whether we should proceed further in it or no.
He answered, "`By all means;`" said he, "`For I will tell you,
that 8000 pounds has been taken from our friends in Lancashire upon this statute,
and the king and myself went to see how much of this money had come into the exchequer.
When we saw it, it appeared that the king was in debt to that account about 28 pounds,
and the rest of the money was gone.`"
I desired of him (seeing it was his advice that we should proceed, and not be discouraged),
that he would be pleased to allow a friend of mine to come in and speak with him,
who was more able to give him an account of this business than myself,
and who had been with the king to get relief in this matter;
for George Whitehead stayed all this while in an adjacent room.
So he bid me bring him up to him.
When George came, he opened the matter fully to him.
When the earl thoroughly understood the matter, he soon got himself ready,
called for his coach, and bid me come to him at an appointed time;
and when the time came, he had with him an absolute order from the king,
to stop all proceedings by sheriffs and bailiffs upon that account in the nation.
In a short time the rage, envy, and cruelty of such devouring men were stopped,
and I know not that any have been troubled or have suffered since upon that statute.
Blessed be God, who hears the cries of the poor, fatherless, and widows,
and sends relief to the afflicted in His own due time.
I must say, that the earl of Powis and his countess
were very ready and willing at all times,
to do our friends any kindness that lay in their way,
and to help them out of their troubles and afflictions;
and I am apt to believe they did it conscientiously,
for there were many of our friends in several of their lordships hereaways,
and the earl never permitted any of us to be fined for
not appearing in any of his courts upon juries,
or in any other way or manner.

In the year 1688,
it seemed good to king James to publish a declaration for liberty of conscience,
and ordered the bishops to send it to their several diocesses, that it might be read.
Seven of them would not read it--bishop Lloyd, before mentioned, was one of them--
and therefore they were committed to the tower.
Then I remembered that which I spoke to the bishop at his palace in the year 1681,
when I queried of him,
"`What if another prince should arise,
who would impose something upon you that you could not do for conscience-sake?`"
And that year when at London, I went to visit him in his troubles; and he said to me,
"`I often thought of your words, and I could wish I were in Pennsylvania now myself.`"
He told me the reason why they could not read the declaration, saying it was arbitrary,
and not according to law, and that it was a matter of conscience to them;
and others were to have their liberty by it, besides Protestant dissenters.
He told me also,
that he had been incited to do those things which he had done against dissenters;
but when I had told him of it before, he could not believe it, till it had happened thus with him.
I had told him formerly,
that I had read a sermon which was preached to
prove the Church of Rome to be a false church,
because she was a persecuting church. "`And now,`" said I,
"`the members of the Church of Rome put you on,
not only to persecute upon the penal laws that were made against dissenters,
but also by those laws that were made against Popish recusants;
and by the same argument may we and they say, the Church of England is a false church,
because it is a persecuting church.`"
The bishop said, they had not considered nor known it then as they did now.
I took my leave of him, and he kindly acknowledged my visit;
and after some time they were released.

Afterwards the bishop came to Welch-Pool, in the week of the court sessions,
and in the evening sent for me to come to the high-sheriff`'s house;
there being with them most of the justices and deputy lieutenants of the county,
with many of the clergy, who were very civil to me.
The bishop told them that he had sent for me,
and that he was more beholden to me than all the men in the diocess,
for I came to visit him in his troubles;
and he desired of them to do me all the kindness they could,
and he would take it as done to himself. When supper was over,
the bishop and the high sheriff (Edward Vaughan, of Llangedwin),
took me into a private room with them, and we discoursed a little about the times.
There was a report at this time of the coming in of the Prince of Orange,
and in a little time I heard an account that the prince had landed,
which was a great satisfaction to the bishop;
for he said some prosecuted him very closely for his life.
And when the Prince of Orange was made king of England,
etc. and liberty of conscience was established by law,
he and others were well satisfied with it.

And now I think it worthy to take notice of the several kindnesses
I received from this bishop Lloyd, in several diocesses,
upon the account of our suffering Friends;
for as we record the hard-heartedness and cruelty we have
found from unmerciful persecuting bishops and clergy,
and how many poor Friends they have made widows and fatherless,
I think it is just and honest of us also to record all the mercy, tenderness,
and compassion we find from those who are conscientious and charitable among them.
For instance:

Bishop Lloyd being at a visitation in Llanvilling in the county of Montgomery,
four peevish men, church-wardens of Welch-Pool, attempted to prosecute my son-in-law,
Jacob Endon, for not paying fees towards the repairs of their worship house.
I went with my son-in-law to wait upon the bishop, and told him the case.
He very quickly called the church wardens,
and told them that there was an act of parliament allowing an easier way
to recover payments by seizure of goods, rather than carrying the matter
to excommunication.
He enquired for a copy of the act, which I gave to him,
and turning to that particular clause, read it to the wardens,
and said that he himself had drawn up that clause in the act,
and then told them how they ought to go to the justices for a warrant.
"`But,`" he said, "`Why pay the cost of obtaining a warrant?
Can you not just go and take from them a pewter dish,
or something else of similar value? I warrant they will never sue you for it. For,`"
said he, "`we must do unto them, as as we would have others to do unto us,
if we were in their condition.`" And so he quickly dispatched them.
Then I told him that I had also come on behalf of a prisoner on the same account,
whose name was also Richard Davies, and who lived near Ruabon, in Denbighshire.
He advised me to speak to the chancellor, Dr. Wynne, whom I should find to be
"`a very fair man.`" So he called him to us,
and left us together, and I took my leave of the bishop, acknowledging his kindness.
When I had fully discoursed with the chancellor about the prisoner,
I indeed found him very fair;
and a little time after, I heard my friend Richard Davies had been discharged;
and several other acts of kindnesses I have received from the chancellor since.
When the said church-wardens came home, they reported the favor I had with the bishop,
and were distraught by it;
but neither myself nor my son-in-law were ever again
troubled about the repairs of their worship house.

Another time when I was going to London, and visiting Friends on my way,
I called at Thomas Burberough`'s, at Aino on the hill, in Northamptonshire,
where I understood he had gone to prison.
I inquired the cause of his imprisonment,
and his wife told me the priest of the parish had let their small tithes,
and other tithes, add up until he thought they amounted to a considerable value;
and then he came and took away nearly all that they had, and sent Thomas to Northampton jail,
where he had been for some time.
I took a memorandum of it, and when I went to London,
I thought of the affliction and exercise of my poor brother.
My old friend bishop Lloyd being then at London, I went to his lodgings at Whitehall,
and I must say, he was very willing to see me.
After some discourse,
I laid the distressed case of my friend Thomas Burberough before him.
He told me he did not know what to do concerning it, the priest of Aino being a stranger to him,
and out of his diocese.
I told him, if he would be pleased to write a few lines to the bishop of Peterborough
(for it was in that diocese),
he might possibly write a few lines to the priest of Aino,
to be more moderate and conscientious
in not taking more than the value of what he thought was due,
and then separating the poor man from his family and casting him into prison also.
I left the case with the bishop,
and he took care to send it to the bishop of Peterborough,
who wrote to the priest of Aino; and bishop Lloyd sent the priest`'s answer,
along with a letter from the bishop of Peterborough to himself,
in a letter of his to me near Welch-Pool;
which I took as a great kindness and favour from him.

Not long after this I went to London again, and called at my friend Thomas Burberough`'s,
where I found him at home, being released.
He told me the priest had sent an order for him to come home;
and that he came to reason and discourse with him.
It seems the priest was not so unkind as he had been formerly.

In the year 1700 there was considerable suffering among Friends in Worcestershire,
an account of which was given me by my friend Edward Bourne of Worcester,
who desired me to use my friendship with bishop Lloyd
as a means for obtaining the relief of John Fowler,
and his mother-in-law, the widow Banbury (who was a prisoner for
tithes in the outer county prison in Worcester),
and he sent me their whole case.
When I understood it, I found a concern upon me to make what haste I could to the bishop,
who was then at his palace at Plartlebury, a few miles from Bewdley.
I considered also how much our friend William Sankey had suffered
on account of one Vernon--a cruel ungodly priest of the parish he lived in,
who had cast him into prison, when he had five or six small children to care for,
his wife having recently died.
This priest took from him several times more than triple the value of his pretended due for tithes.

From Bewdley I went to William Sankey`'s, and told him I was going to the bishop,
and desired him to go with me;
and in the morning we went together.
I inquired for the bishop`'s secretary, Francis Evans, who very lovingly came to us,
brought us in, and said he would inform his lord that I was there;
and in a little time the bishop came to us.
And after some discourse I told the bishop, I had not only come to give him a visit,
but I had come from home purposely on behalf of some friends of mine,
who suffered for tithes in that country:
and that I was informed there had been three committed to Worcester jail by one Kerry,
the priest of Tredington, and that two of them were released,
and the third remained a prisoner.
"`Released,`" said he, "`how are they released?`"
I told him, "`by the hand of their great Creator.`" "`It seems then,`" said he, "`they are dead.`"
"`And the same man,`" said I, "`does prosecute the widow of one of them, William Banbury,
and has already put her into your court,
for that which her husband suffered and died for; and we believe, that in common law,
when the prisoner dies in prison, the prosecution ceases.`"
"`I do not know,`" said he, "`but that the debt may be paid, but the charges are not;
and I know not what to do with that priest, for I hear he is a very covetous man,
and I have no power over him but once in three years.
I was lately on my visitation there, and had I known this then,
I might have done your friends some kindness.`"
I said, "`If you will be so kind as to write a few lines to him,
and let him know what complaint is made to you of him,
and how you are informed that two of the three which he sent to prison are dead,
I do not doubt it might stop his rage and severe prosecution against the poor widow,
and possibly be the means of releasing the other prisoner also.`"
So he bid his secretary to take notice of it, and he put him in mind to write to him.

Then I told him of the sufferings of William Sankey, who was there present,
and desired him to give my friend permission to open the case to him himself, which he did;
and he told how cruel the said Vernon had been to him in casting him into jail,
(his wife being dead, and leaving him five or six small children); and he told him,
that Vernon had taken from him goods worth about 12 pounds
for about three or four pounds demanded for tithes;
and about twelve or fourteen pounds worth of sheep, for the same demand at another time;
and several other cruelties that had been done to him by this unconscionable Vernon.
Upon taking it into consideration,
the bishop caused his secretary to draw up an order for Vernon to come there with his accounts
of what was due to him from William Sankey,
and what he had taken from William Sankey towards that account;
and he gave the order to William Sankey, to deliver to the priest,
and desired William to be there the day appointed, with the priest.
I was informed the priest went a day early to the bishop,
and William Sankey went the day appointed; and I was informed that the bishop said
that there was no helping what was past,
but he would take care that the priest should do so no more to William Sankey.
I have heard since that time, that the priest has taken in kindness what was due to him,
with more moderation than before,
and that the bishop was kind to William Sankey ever since.

John Fowler, one of the three before mentioned, was discharged
(Robert Grimes and William Banbury being dead).
And as for the widow Banbury`'s case, who was severely prosecuted by the priest
(he intending to bring it to an excommunication), that was stopped,
and she was troubled no more.

Before I parted with the bishop, I told him there was a friend of ours, William Cattril,
that kept a school at Worcester,
who was persecuted very closely by some for keeping school without a license,
and they did intend to bring him under an _Excommunicato capiendo;_
and if the bishop did not undertake to show him kindness,
they would trouble him and charge him with all they could.
The bishop bid his secretary to take care of it.
So all that I requested of the bishop at that time was in friendliness and kindness granted me,
and care was taken that Friends were not troubled nor molested on these accounts.
Then the bishop ordered us to dine there that day,
and we parted in friendliness and love with him; and he desired me, whenever I came that way,
not to pass by as if a stranger.
From there I went to Worcester,
and gave Friends an account of my success with
the bishop. I stayed with them a little while,
and then went to Bromyard, and had a meeting there.
So I went through part of Herefordshire to Leominster,
and I can bless and praise the name of the Lord, who was with me all along on my journey,
and brought me safely home to my wife and family;
and when I gave them an account of my journey, they praised the Lord with me,
who had been my preserver and defender.

A little time after, I went to London,
and being at the meeting concerning Friends`' sufferings,
there was mentioned the sufferings of Friends in
Lancaster castle by the dean and chapter of Worcester.
They had been there for several years,
though Friends had tried to get them out,
and Friends at Worcester had attempted to use their
recognition with the chancellor, who seemed to be very kind to them,
as a means of obtaining their freedom;
and yet for all that they could not get them discharged.
When I came from London I went to the bishop at Worcester.
He was very free with me, and in a little time the chancellor came to us,
and the bishop informed me who he was.
I told him I was glad to see them both together, and said,
"`When I was lately in London, we laid the sufferings of our Friends in Lancashire before us,
on account of the small matter of tithes,
alledged to belong to the dean and chapter of Worcester;`"
and I told the bishop that I thought the chancellor was not ignorant of it,
for I heard he had often been solicited on their behalf. The chancellor told him
he did understand it, and that these men were there for a small inconsiderable matter;
and said he was sorry that those men died in Worcester,
because for conscience sake they could not pay that little tithe to the priest of Tredinglon,
and he was afraid these men would die there also,
unless some way was found for their release.
The bishop asked how long they had been there;
I think the chancellor said four or five years.
The bishop said, "`Discharge them, discharge them;`"
and ordered them to be discharged without paying any fees.
After a little time I parted with the bishop and chancellor,
and acknowledged their kindness.
I went to Friends in the city of Worcester,
and told William Pardee what success I had with the bishop,
and desired them to wait on the chancellor to get the order, that it might be sent speedily;
and in a little time I heard they were discharged.

+++[+++__Hitherto, reader,
you have had a short relation of some of the labours and services of
our ancient and honourable friend Richard Davies from his own account,
which he finished a little before his decease; it remains, therefore,
to give some account of his last year`'s travels, etc.,
together with the time and manner of his departure, etc.__]

[.small-break]
'''

In the year 1702, he went to London, his daughter Tace Endon accompanying him,
and stayed in and about the city several weeks, visiting Friends in their meetings,
where he had many good and comfortable opportunities among them.
He, together with eleven other Friends,
were appointed by the yearly meeting to go to the queen at Windsor,
with an acknowledgment from Friends for the continuation of their liberty,
and protection under her government; at which time he in particular spoke to the queen.
When he was clear of those parts, he returned homewards, and came through Worcester,
where he went to visit his old friend bishop Lloyd, who was glad to see him.
That was the last time they saw each other.

After his return home he often visited some neighbouring meetings,
and was at the yearly meeting of Wales the following spring.

About the latter end of the third month, 1704,
he went up to London again to the yearly meeting, his grandson David Endon attending him.
He visited Friends as he passed through Stourbridge, Banbury, Aylesbury,
etc. and stayed in and about the city for nearly two months, being somewhat weak and sickly.
When he was clear of the city, he returned pretty directly home,
and came safely to his family.

In the beginning of the year 1705, he met with some exercise;
for on the 1st of the third month, his dear and honest wife died,
who had been very tender and careful over him,
and a woman very serviceable to Friends and truth in many respects.
She was a plain, upright, and honest-hearted woman--one that loved truth in simplicity.
She left a good testimony behind her, after they had lived together about forty-six years.

In the first month, 1706, he was at the yearly meeting of Wales (in Llanidlos,
Montgomeryshire), being the last yearly meeting he was at in Wales.
On the 15th of the second month following he
took his journey with his grandson David Endon,
towards Bristol.
He had a meeting at Leominster, and at Ross in Herefordshire,
and from there went to Bristol, and lodged at Charles Harford`'s, Jr.,
where he visited Friends at their yearly meeting, and stayed about a week;
and on the 30th of the second month, set forward towards London, and came to Frenchay,
and had a meeting there.
The 1st of the third month he had a meeting at Sodbury in Gloucestershire;
the 5th at Cirencester; the 8th at Oxford, being the first-day of the week,
where many of the scholars came in, and were rude for some time;
but after our friend Richard Davies had spoken a while in the meeting,
they became more sober; some of them sat down,
and stayed till the conclusion of the meeting;
and Friends took notice that the meeting was more quiet than usual.
From there he went to Henley, and had a meeting there; and so to Windsor,
where he had a meeting; from there he went to London,
and lodged at his friend and kinsman Thomas Lloyd`'s. He attended the yearly meeting,
and stayed in and about the city, visiting Friends at their meetings,
until the 19th of the fourth month, at which time he returned homewards,
and had a meeting the 21st at Chesham, where William Bingley was.
On the 22nd they had a meeting at Aylesbury,
and went from there to their yearly meeting at Banbury,
where were many Friends from various parts.
The 28th he came to Worcester, William Bingley still accompanying him,
where they had a meeting.
The 30th he went to Droitwitch, and had a meeting there.
The 1st of the fifth month he had a meeting at Bromsgrove; the 2nd at Birmingham,
and lodged at John Pemberton`'s;
the 4th he went to the quarterly meeting at Wolverhampton,
and passed from there to Stourbridge, and lodged at Ambrose Crowley`'s;
and so upon the 9th of the fifth month, 1706,
he returned safely home to his family at Cloddiecochion, near Welch-Pool,
having been away nearly three months.

After this journey he continued mostly at home, in his usual health,
and visited several neighbouring meetings.
In the latter end of the eighth month, he was at the burial of an ancient woman Friend,
Anne Thomas, in Salop, and at several other burials near home;
at which times he often had very good service, and people would hear him gladly,
for he had a solid and grave delivery, and was wise and sound in his matter,
which was very taking with most people.

His last sickness was very short; for on the sixth-day of the week he was at Welch-Pool,
and finding himself not well, went home, and the next day kept to his house.
On first-day following several Friends went to see him from Dolobran meeting,
and had a little opportunity to wait together upon the Lord with him.
He spoke very little to any; and his pain continuing upon him, the next day,
being the 22nd of the first month, 1708, at about the ninth hour in the morning,
he quietly departed this life, being in the seventy-third year of his age.

The 25th being the day appointed for his burial, many Friends from various parts,
and other people, met at his house at Cloddiecochion,
and his body was borne by them to the graveyard, near his own house,
and there decently interred near his wife`'s grave.
In the graveyard a solemn meeting was held, and several testimonies were borne,
in the power and life of truth, to the general satisfaction of the people.
